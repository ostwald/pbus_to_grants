In this study, we assess the capabilities of deterministic and probabilistic cool-season quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) produced by the 10-member, convection-permitting (3-km horizontal grid spacing) NCAR Ensemble using observations collected by SNOTEL stations at mountain locations across the western United States and precipitation analyses from PRISM. We also examine the performance of operational forecast systems run by NCEP including the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, the NAM forecast system with a 3-km continental United States (CONUS) nest, GFS, and the Short-Range Ensemble Forecast system (SREF). Overall, we find that higher-resolution models, such as the HRRR, NAM-3km CONUS nest, and an individual member of the NCAR Ensemble, are more deterministically skillful than coarser models, especially over the narrow interior ranges of the western United States, likely because they better resolve topography and thus better simulate orographic precipitation. The 10-member NCAR Ensemble is also more probabilistically skillful than 13-member subensembles composed of each SREF dynamical core, but less probabilistically skillful than the full 26-member SREF, as a result of insufficient spread. These results should help guide future short-range model development and inform forecasters about the capabilities and limitations of several widely used deterministic and probabilistic modeling systems over the western United States.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
