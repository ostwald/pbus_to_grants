We also include pumping in the induction equation, and we take the three configurations studied in the decaying case in Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. E 81, 016318 (2010)]. To that effect, we employ direct numerical simulations up to an equivalent resolution of 20483 grid points. We find that, similarly to the case when the forcing is absent, different spectral indices for the total energy spectrum emerge, corresponding to either a Kolmogorov law, an Iroshnikov-Kraichnan law that arises from the interactions of turbulent eddies and Alfven waves, or to weak turbulence when the large-scale magnetic field is strong. We also examine the inertial range dynamics in terms of the ratios of kinetic to magnetic energy, and of the turnover time to the Alfven time, and analyze the temporal variations of these quasiequilibria.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
