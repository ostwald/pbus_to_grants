This allows us to study the role of radiation-induced coherence among the upper terms of the spectral series, and its contribution to Rayleigh scattering and the polarization of the solar continuum. We rely on previous theoretical results for the emissivity of a three-term atom of the A-type, taking into account partially coherent scattering, and generalize its expression in order to describe a "multiple A" atomic system underlying the formation of a spectral series. Our study shows that important polarization effects must be expected because of the combined action of partial frequency redistribution and radiation-induced coherence among the terms of the series. In particular, our model predicts the correct asymptotic limit of 100% polarization in the far wings of a complete (i.e., Delta L = 0, +/- 1) group of transitions, which must be expected on the basis of the principle of spectroscopic stability.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
