Accurately placing the Sun on the S scale is important for comparing solar activity to that of the Sunlike stars. We present previously unpublished measurements of the reflected sunlight from the Moon using the second-generation MWO HK photometer during solar cycle 23 and determine cycle minimum S-23,S-min = 0.1634 +/- 0.0008, amplitude Delta S-23= 0.0143 +/- 0.0012, and mean &lt; S-23 &gt; = 0.1701 +/- 0.0005. By establishing a proxy relationship with the closely related National Solar Observatory Sacramento Peak calcium K emission index, itself well correlated with the Kodaikanal Observatory plage index, we extend the MWO S time series to cover cycles 15-24 and find on average &lt; S-min &gt; = 0.1621 +/- 0.0008, &lt;Delta S-cyc &gt; = 0.0145 +/- 0.0012, &lt; S-cyc &gt; = 0.1694 +/- 0.0005. Our measurements represent an improvement over previous estimates that relied on stellar measurements or solar proxies with non-overlapping time series. We find good agreement from these results with measurements by the Solar-Stellar Spectrograph at Lowell Observatory, an independently calibrated instrument, which gives us additional confidence that we have accurately placed the Sun on the S-index flux scale.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
