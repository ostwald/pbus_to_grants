Tangent linear models (TLMs) designed to predict the differences between perturbed and unperturbed simulations of the weather forecast are a key component of such 4DVAR schemes. However, many forecasting centers have found that TLMs and their adjoints do not scale well computationally and are difficult to create and maintain-particularly for coupled ocean-wave-ice-atmosphere models. In this paper, the authors create ensemble-based TLMs (ETLMs) and test their ability to propagate both climatological and flow-dependent parts of hybrid error covariance models. These tests demonstrate that rank deficiency limits the utility of unlocalized ETLMs. High-rank, time-evolving, flow-adaptive localization functions are constructed and tested using recursive application of short-duration ETLMs, each of which is localized using a static localization. Since TLM operators do not need to be semipositive definite, the authors experiment with a variety of localization approaches including step function localization. The step function localization leads to a local formulation that was found to be highly effective. In tests using simple one-dimensional models with both dispersive and nondispersive dynamics, it is shown that practical ETLM configurations were effective at propagating covariances as far as four error correlation scales.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
