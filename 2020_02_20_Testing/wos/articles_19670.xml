Thus, small magnetic structures are good tracers of turbulent flows. We study the migration and dispersal of magnetic bright features (MBFs) in intergranular areas observed at high spatial resolution with SUNRISE/IMaX. We describe the flux dispersal of individual MBFs as a diffusion process whose parameters are computed for various areas in the quiet-Sun and the vicinity of active regions from seeing-free data. We find that magnetic concentrations are best described as random walkers close to network areas (diffusion index, gamma = 1.0), travelers with constant speeds over a supergranule (gamma = 1.9-2.0), and decelerating movers in the vicinity of flux emergence and/or within active regions (gamma = 1.4-1.5). The three types of regions host MBFs with mean diffusion coefficients of 130 km(2) s(-1), 80-90 km(2) s(-1), and 25-70 km(2) s(-1), respectively. The MBFs in these three types of regions are found to display a distinct kinematic behavior at a confidence level in excess of 95%.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
