In particular, a diurnal asymmetry in the magnitude and sign of the surface temperature response to deforestation (T-S) has been observed, but the biophysical processes that contribute to day and nighttime T-S are not fully understood. In this study, we use a space-for-time approach with satellite and reanalysis data to investigate the biophysical processes that control the day and nighttime T-S. Additionally, we incorporate flux-tower data to examine two hypotheses for nighttime forest warming relative to open lands: (1) that forests generate turbulence in the stable nocturnal boundary layer, which brings heat aloft down to the surface, and (2) that forests store more heat during the day and release it at night. Our results confirm a diurnal asymmetry in T-S. Over most regions of the world, deforestation results in daytime warming and nighttime cooling. The strongest daytime warming is in the tropics, where the average T-S is 4.40.07K. The strongest nighttime cooling is observed in the boreal zone, where open lands are cooler than forests by an average of 1.40.04K. Daytime patterns of T-S are explained by differences in the latent heat flux (LE) and absorbed solar radiation (K-a). We find that nighttime T-S is related to the strength of the nocturnal temperature inversion, with stronger temperature inversions at high latitudes and weak inversions in the tropics. Forest turbulence at night combined with stored heat release drives nighttime T-S patterns.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
