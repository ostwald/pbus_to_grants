The range and is divided into eight regions, and in each of the regions, multiple linear regression is performed to obtain non-iterative solutions for surface fluxes. As compared to the other two most recent non-iterative schemes, we show that the suggested scheme has the smallest bias. The maximum relative errors of turbulent transfer coefficients for momentum and sensible heat , as compared to those obtained from the classic iterative method, are always smaller than 2 % from our new non-iterative scheme.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
