We demonstrate that the solver converges, that tracer simulations initialized with the solution from the solver have small drift, and that the solver takes orders of magnitude less computational time than the brute force spin-up approach. To demonstrate the application of the solver, we use it to efficiently spin up the tracer ideal age with respect to the circulation from different time intervals in a long physics run. We then evaluate how the spun-up ideal age tracer depends on the duration of the physics run, i.e., on how equilibrated the circulation is. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
