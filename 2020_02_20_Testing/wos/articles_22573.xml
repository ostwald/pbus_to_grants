Volume information on the magnetic field mostly relies on coupling 3D reconstruction methods with photospheric and/or chromospheric surface vector magnetic fields. Infrared coronal polarimetry could provide additional information to better constrain magnetic field reconstructions. However, combining such data with reconstruction methods is challenging, e.g., because of the optical thinness of the solar corona and the lack and limitations of stereoscopic polarimetry. To address these issues, we introduce the data-optimized coronal field model (DOCFM) framework, a model-data fitting approach that combines a parameterized 3D generative model, e.g., a magnetic field extrapolation or a magneto hydrodynamic model, with forward modeling of coronal data. We test it with a parameterized flux-rope insertion method and infrared coronal polarimetry where synthetic observations are created from a known "ground-truth" physical state. We show that this framework allows us to accurately retrieve the ground-truth 3D magnetic field of a set of force-free field solutions from the flux-rope insertion method. In observational studies, the DOCFM will provide a means to force the solutions derived with different reconstruction methods to satisfy additional common coronal constraints. The DOCFM framework therefore opens new perspectives for the exploitation of coronal polarimetry in magnetic field reconstructions and for developing new techniques to more reliably infer the 3D magnetic fields that trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
