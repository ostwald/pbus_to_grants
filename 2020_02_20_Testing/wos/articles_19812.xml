Observed meteorological and ground concentration measurements from the real-world Dipole Pride controlled release experiment are used to test the methodology. A sensitivity study is performed to quantify the relative contribution of the number and location of sensor measurements by progressively removing them. Additionally, the importance of the meteorological measurements is tested by progressively removing surface observations and vertical profiles. It is shown that the source term reconstruction can occur also with limited meteorological observations. The proposed general methodology can be applied to reconstruct the characteristics of an unknown atmospheric release given limited ground and meteorological observations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
