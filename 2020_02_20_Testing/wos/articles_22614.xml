Fractional snow cover (FSC) derived from five satellite sources [the three satellites comprising the multisensor synergy of FengYun-3 (FY-3A/B/C), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS)] were intercompared over the QTP to examine uncertainties in mean snow cover and interannual variability over the last decade. A four-step cloud removal procedure was developed for MODIS and FY-3 data, which effectively reduced the cloud percentage from about 40% to 2%-3% with an error of about 2% estimated by a random sampling method. Compared to in situ snow-depth observations, the cloud-removed FY-3B data have an annual classification accuracy of about 94% for both 0.04 degrees and 0.01 degrees resolutions, which is higher than other datasets and is recommended for use in QTP studies. Among the five datasets analyzed, IMS has the largest snow extent (22% higher than MODIS) and the highest FSC (4.7% higher than MODIS), while the morning-overpass MODIS and FY-3A/C FSC are similar and are around 5% higher than the afternoon-overpass FY-3B FSC. Contrary to MODIS, IMS shows increasing variability in snow cover and snow duration over the last decade (2006-17). Differences in variabilities of FSC and snow duration between products are greater at 5-6 km than lower elevations, with seasonal snow-cover change showing the largest uncertainty in snowmelt date.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
