The temporal evolution of O-3 during the first 6 years of IASI (2008-2013) operation is investigated with multivariate regressions separately in four different layers (ground-300, 300-150, 150-25, 25-3aEuro-hPa), by adjusting to the daily time series averaged in 20A degrees zonal bands, seasonal and linear trend terms along with important geophysical drivers of O-3 variation (e.g. solar flux, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO)). The regression model is shown to perform generally very well with a strong dominance of the annual harmonic terms and significant contributions from O-3 drivers, in particular in the equatorial region where the QBO and the solar flux contribution dominate. More particularly, despite the short period of the IASI data set available up to now, two noticeable statistically significant apparent trends are inferred from the daily IASI measurements: a positive trend in the upper stratosphere (e.g. 1.74aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.77aEuro-DUaEuro-year(-1) between 30 and 50A degrees aEuro-S), which is consistent with other studies suggesting a turnaround for stratospheric O-3 recovery, and a negative trend in the troposphere at the mid-latitudes and high northern latitudes (e.g. -0.26aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.11aEuro-DUaEuro-year(-1) between 30 and 50A degrees aEuro-N), especially during summer and probably linked to the impact of decreasing ozone precursor emissions. The impact of the high temporal sampling of IASI on the uncertainty in the determination of O-3 trend has been further explored by performing multivariate regressions on IASI monthly averages and on ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
