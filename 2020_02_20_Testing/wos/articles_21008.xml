Nevertheless, the needs of the adjoint model and the linearization of the forecast model largely limit the wider applications of 4DVar. 4D ensemble-variational data assimilation methods (4DEnVars) exploit the strengths of the Ensemble Kalman Filter and 4DVar, and use the ensemble trajectories to directly estimate four-dimensional background error covariance. This study evaluates the role of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis in 4DEnVars. The widely-recognized 4DEnVar method DRP-4DVar (the Dimension-reduced projection 4DVar) is adopted as the representation of EOF analyses in this study. The performance of the Dimension-reduced projection 4DVar (DRP-4DVar), 4DEnVar (i.e., another traditional 4DEnVar scheme without EOF transformation), and the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) was compared to demonstrate the effect of the EOF analysis in DRP-4DVar. Sensitivity experiments indicate that EOF analyses construct basis vectors in eigenvalue space and the dimension reduction in the DRP-4DVar approach helps improve computational efficiency and analysis accuracy. When compared with 4DEnVar and the ETKF, the DRP-4DVar demonstrates similar analysis root-mean-square error (RMSE) to 4DEnVar, whereas it surpasses the ETKF by 22.3%. In addition, sensitivity experiments of DRP-4DVar on the ensemble size, the assimilation window length, and the standard deviation of the initial perturbation imply that the DRP-4DVar with the optimized EOF truncation number is robust to a wide range of the parameters, but extremely low values should be avoided. The results presented here suggest the potential wide application of EOF analysis in the hybrid 4DEnVar methods.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
