In order to mitigate the pine beetle epidemic, statistical modeling is needed to predict both the occurrence and the extent of pine beetle damage. Using data on the front range mountains in Colorado between the years 2001-2010 from the National Forest Service, we develop a zero-augmented spatio-temporal beta regression model to predict both the occurrence of pine beetle damage (a binary outcome) and, given damage occurred, the percent of the region infected. Temporal evolution of the pine beetle damage is captured using a dynamic linear model where both the probability and extent of damage depend on the amount of damage incurred in neighboring regions in the previous time period. A sparse conditional autoregressive model is used to capture any spatial information not modeled by spatially varying covariates. We find that the occurrence and extent of pine beetle damage are positively associated with slope and damage in previous time periods.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
