Here we present and compare three 25-year present-day offline simulations with chemical mechanisms of different levels of complexity using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Version 1.2 CAM-chem (CAM4): the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 4 (MOZART-4) mechanism, the Reduced Hydrocarbon mechanism, and the Super-Fast mechanism. We show that, for most regions and time periods, differences in simulated ozone chemistry between these three mechanisms are smaller than the model-observation differences themselves. The MOZART-4 mechanism and the Reduced Hydrocarbon are in close agreement in their representation of ozone throughout the troposphere during all time periods (annual, seasonal, and diurnal). While the Super-Fast mechanism tends to have higher simulated ozone variability and differs from the MOZART-4 mechanism over regions of high biogenic emissions, it is surprisingly capable of simulating ozone adequately given its simplicity. We explore the tradeoffs between chemical mechanism complexity and computational cost by identifying regions where the simpler mechanisms are comparable to the MOZART-4 mechanism and regions where they are not. The Super-Fast mechanism is 3 times as fast as the MOZART-4 mechanism, which allows for longer simulations or ensembles with more members that may not be feasible with the MOZART-4 mechanism given limited computational resources.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
