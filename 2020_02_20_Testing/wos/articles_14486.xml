Attenuation, reflections, and induced cross polarization are evaluated for different rainfall conditions and radome types. The authors present a model for estimating the drop size distribution on a radome surface based on skin surface material, area, inclination, and rainfall rate. Then, a multilayer radome model based on the transmission-line-equivalent circuit model is used to characterize the radome's scattering parameters. Numerical results are compared with radar data obtained in the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) and Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) systems, and good agreement is found.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
