The driving motive for this study is to develop a numerical algorithm that respects these constraints while improving accuracy and robustness. This study introduces the ADER-DT (Arbitrary DERivatives in time and space-differential transform) time discretization to positive-definite, weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO)-limited, finite volume transport on the cubed sphere in lieu of semidiscrete integrators. The cost of the ADER-DT algorithm is significantly improved from previous implementations without affecting accuracy. A new function-based WENO implementation is also detailed for use with the ADER-DT time discretization. While ADER-DT costs about 1.5 times more than a fourth-order, five-stage strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK4) method, it is far more computationally dense (which is advantageous on accelerators such as graphics processing units), and it has a larger effective maximum stable time step. ADER-DT errors converge more quickly with grid refinement than SSPRK4, giving 6.5 times less error in the L-infinity norm than SSPRK4 at the highest refinement level for smooth data. For nonsmooth data, ADER-DT resolves C-0 discontinuities more sharply. For a complex flow field, ADER exhibits less phase error than SSPRK4. Improving both accuracy and robustness as well as better respecting modern computational efficiency requirements, we believe the method presented herein is competitive for efficiently transporting tracers over the sphere for applications targeting modern computing architectures.</p><p>Plain Language Summary This study introduces and analyzes a numerical technique for transporting quantities on the sphere using wind trajectories that explicitly takes into account the needs of modern massively parallel computer architectures while simultaneously improving accuracy and robustness. On modern computers, moving data around is extremely expensive, while performing computations on data is extremely cheap. Therefore, algorithms that perform as many useful computations on a given chunk of data before moving it will be rewarded with better efficiency. While doing this, the algorithm must continue to respect traditional accuracy constraints as well such as conserving mass, giving useful solutions without noise contamination, and resolving features as well as possible. The method presented here performs nearly all of the computations on a small chunk of data without having to move the data intermittently. Therefore, it will perform very well on accelerator devices such as graphics processing units compared to existing methods, which interrupt the computation with many intermittent spurts of data movement. Test cases show that for smooth and nonsmooth data as well as simple and complex flow fields, the proposed algorithm not only fits into modern computing constraints but also improves accuracy compared to current methods.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
