Based on plausible ranges of terrestrial C: N stoichiometry, this study investigates whether the terrestrial C sequestration projections of nine CMIP5 models for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are consistent with estimates of N supply from increased biological fixation, atmospheric deposition, and reduced ecosystem N losses. Discrepancies between the timing and places of N demand and supply indicated increases in terrestrial N implicit to the projections of all nine CMIP5 models under all scenarios that are larger than the estimated N supply. Omitting N constraints leads to an overestimation of land C sequestration in these models between the years 1860 and 2100 by between 97 Pg C (69-252 Pg C; RCP 2.6) and 150 Pg C (57-323 Pg C; RCP 8.5), with a large spread across models. The CMIP5 models overestimated the average 2006-2100 fossil-fuel emissions required to keep atmospheric CO2 levels on the trajectories described in the RCP scenarios by between 0.6 Pg C yr(-1) (0.4-2.2 Pg C yr(-1); RCP 2.6) and 1.2 Pg C yr(-1) (0.5-3.3 Pg C yr(-1); RCP 8.5). If unabated, reduced land C sequestration would enhance CO2 accumulation in the ocean and atmosphere, increasing atmospheric CO2 burden by 26 ppm (16-88 ppm; RCP 2.6) to 61 ppm (29-147 ppm; RCP 8.5) by the year 2100.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
