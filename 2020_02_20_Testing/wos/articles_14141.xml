Coriolis forces from differential rotation play a large role in determining what the meridional circulation is. Here, we consider the question of whether a stellar differential rotation that is constant on cylinders concentric with the rotation axis can drive a meridional circulation. Conventional wisdom says that it can not. Using two related forms of the governing equations that respectively estimate the longitudinal components of the curl of the meridional mass flux and the vorticity, we show that such differential rotation will drive a meridional flow. This is because to satisfy anelastic mass conservation, non-spherically symmetric pressure contours must be present for all differential rotations, not just ones that depart from constancy on cylinders concentric with the rotation axis. Therefore, the fluid is always baroclinic if differential rotation is present. This is because, in anelastic systems, the perturbation pressure must satisfy a Poisson type equation, as well as an equation of state and a thermodynamic equation. We support our qualitative reasoning with numerical examples, and show that meridional circulation is sensitive to the magnitude and form of departures from rotation constant on cylinders. The effect should be present in 3D global anelastic convection simulations, particularly those for which the differential rotation driven by global convection is nearly cylindrical in profile. For solar-like differential rotation, Coriolis forces generally drive a two-celled circulation in each hemisphere, with a second, reversed flow at high latitudes. For solar like turbulent viscosities, the meridional circulation produced by Coriolis forces is much larger than observed on the Sun. Therefore, there must be at least one additional force, probably a buoyancy force, which opposes the meridional flow to bring its amplitude down to observed values.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
