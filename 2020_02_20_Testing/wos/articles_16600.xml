The height of the MBL (MBLH) is estimated using three RO-derived parameters: the bending angle, refractivity, and water vapor pressure computed from the refractivity derived from a one-dimensional variational data inversion (1D-VAR) procedure. Two different diagnostic methods (minimum gradient and break point method) are compared. The results show that, although a negative bias in the refractivity exists as a result of superrefraction, the spatial and temporal variations of the MBLH determined from the RO observations are consistent with those from CALIOP and the radiosondes. The authors find that the minimum gradient in the RO bending angle gives the most accurate estimation of the MBL height.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
