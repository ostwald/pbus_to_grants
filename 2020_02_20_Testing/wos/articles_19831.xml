Here we show using observations and an ensemble of global warming simulations the combined impact of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and long-term warming on regional SAT extremes. We find a robust relationship between ENSO and southeast Asian SATs wherein virtually all April extremes occur during El Nino years. We then quantify the relative contributions of long-term warming and the 2015-16 El Nino to the extreme April 2016 SATs. The results indicate that global warming increases the likelihood of record-breaking April extremes where we estimate that 29% of the 2016 anomaly was caused by warming and 49% by El Nino. These post-Nino Aprils can potentially be anticipated a few months in advance, and thus, help societies prepare for the projected continued increases in extremes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
