Its performance in comparison to other probes and the development of new corrections applied to the data are presented. The SID-2H detected small ice crystals among larger particles. It correctly identified water drops, and discriminated between round and irregular particle shapes in water-dominated clouds with errors less than 5%. Remaining uncertainties in the sensing volume and the volume over which coincidence of particles occurred, result in the data being used here in a qualitative manner to identify the presence of ice, and its habits and sizes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
