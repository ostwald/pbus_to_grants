Numerous parameters are perturbed within the Morrison microphysics scheme. The parameters that most affect cloud and precipitation characteristics are the snow fall speed coefficient As, snow particle density rho(s), rain accretion (WRA), and ice-cloud water collection efficiency (ECI). Surface precipitation rates are affected by A(s) and rho(s) through changes to the precipitation efficiency caused by direct and indirect impacts on snow fall speed, respectively. WRA and ECI both affect the amount of cloud water removed, but the precipitation sensitivity differs. Large WRA results in increased precipitation efficiency and cloud water removal below the freezing level, indirectly decreasing cloud condensation rates; the net result is little precipitation sensitivity. Large ECI removes cloud water above the freezing level but with little influence on overall condensation rates. Two environmental experiments are performed to test the robustness of the results: 1) reduction of the wind speed profile by 30% (LowU) and 2) decreasing the surface potential temperature to induce a freezing level below the mountain top (LowFL). Parameter perturbations within LowU result in similar mechanisms acting on precipitation, but a much weaker sensitivity compared to the control. The LowFL case shows rho(s) is no longer a dominant parameter and A(s) now induces changes to cloud condensation, since more of the cloud depth is present above the freezing level. In general, perturbations to microphysical parameters affect the location of peak precipitation, while the total amount of precipitation is more sensitive to environmental parameter perturbations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
