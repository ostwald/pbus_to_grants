MMFs of the same and opposite polarity, with respect to the pore, are found to stream from its border at an average speed of 1.3 km s(-1) and 1.2 km s(-1), respectively, with mainly same-polarity MMFs found further away from the pore. MMFs of both polarities are found to harbor rather weak, inclined magnetic fields. Opposite-polarity MMFs are blueshifted, whereas same-polarity MMFs do not show any preference for up-or downflows. Most of the MMFs are found to be of sub-arcsecond size and carry a mean flux of similar to 1.2 x 10(17) Mx.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
