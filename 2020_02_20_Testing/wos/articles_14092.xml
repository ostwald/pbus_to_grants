The semi-implicit CISL solver uses the inherently conservative semi-Lagrangian multitracer transport scheme (CSLAM) and a new flux-form semi-implicit formulation of the continuity equation that ensures numerically consistent transport. The flux-form semi-implicit formulation is based on a recent successful approach in a shallow-water equations (SWE) solver (CSLAM-SW). With the new approach, the CISL semi-implicit nonhydrostatic solver (CSLAM-NH) is able to ensure conservative and consistent transport by avoiding the need for a time-independent mean reference state. Like its SWE counterpart, the nonhydrostatic solver presented here is designed to be similar to typical semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit schemes, such that only a single linear Helmholtz equation solution and a single call to CSLAM are required per time step. To demonstrate its stability and accuracy, the solver is applied to a set of three idealized test cases: a density current (dry), a gravity wave (dry), and a squall line (moist). A fourth test case shows that shape preservation of passive tracers is ensured by coupling the semi-implicit CISL formulation with existing shape-preserving filters. Results show that CSLAM-NH solutions compare well with other existing solvers for the three test cases, and that it is shape preserving.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
