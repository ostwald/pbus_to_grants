The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board Himawari-8 provides continuous high-resolution observations of severe weather phenomena in space and time. In this study, the capability to assimilate AHI radiances has been developed within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model's data assimilation system. As the first attempt to assimilate AHI using WRF data assimilation at convective scales, the added value of hourly AHI clear-sky radiances from three water vapor channels on convection-permitting (3km) analyses and forecasts of the 7.19 severe rainstorm that occurred over north China during 18-21 July 2016 was investigated. Analyses were produced hourly, and 24h forecasts were produced every 6h. The results showed that improved wind and humidity fields were obtained in analyses and forecasts verified against conventional observations after assimilating AHI water vapor radiances when compared to the control experiment which assimilated only conventional observations. It was also found that the assimilation of AHI water vapor radiances had a clearly positive impact on the rainfall forecast for the first 6h lead time, especially for heavy rainfall exceeding 100mm when verified against the observed rainfall. Furthermore, the horizontal and vertical distribution of features in the moisture fields were improved after assimilating AHI water vapor radiances, eventually contributing to a better forecast of the severe rainstorm.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
