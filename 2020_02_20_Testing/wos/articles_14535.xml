Observations from the MIPAS and SABER satellite instruments indicate that the highest ozone mixing ratios are seen during the late fall to early winter period in both hemispheres and for all years examined. Simulations using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) find qualitatively the same seasonal evolution. Analysis of WACCM results shows that the high ozone concentration is due in part to the relatively quiet dynamical conditions in early winter. The mean circulation, which brings warmer temperatures and higher concentrations of H, is weaker in early winter than during middle and late winter. H in the late fall to early winter period drops to the lowest levels seen during the year due to lack of a source from photochemistry, weak transport into the region by the mean circulation, and continual loss due to diffusive separation. The low concentration of H leads to higher ozone.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
