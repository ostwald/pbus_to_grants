We attribute the dominant driver of this variability to a combination of tides generated in situ and in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. We identify nonmigrating tidal signatures attributable to the latter source that are ubiquitous, persistent, and significant at all thermospheric latitudes. Further, these perturbations underlie the upper atmospheric response to solar geomagnetic disturbances and are measurably altered, along with their migrating counterparts, during the storm. Our investigation is centered on a series of National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model simulations during 1-10 April 2010, including an optimal simulation with lower boundary forcing based on Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application reanalysis data and upper boundary forcing based on satellite and ground magnetometer measurements and the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics procedure and three diagnostic simulations. The differences between the optimal and diagnostic simulations allow us to quantify thermospheric variability attributable to solar geomagnetic forcing and dynamical effects propagating into the thermosphere from below. We find that they can be comparable at high latitudes for some nonmigrating tidal components.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
