However, the technique as originally developed makes some simplistic assumptions about the heights of ground targets (HT) and the vertical gradient of refractivity (dN/dh). In reality, the field of target phases used for refractivity retrieval is noisy because of varying terrain and introduces estimation biases. To obtain a refractivity map at a constant height above terrain, a 2D horizontal refractivity field at the radar height must be computed and corrected for altitude using an average dN/dh. This is achieved by theoretically clarifying the interpretation of the measured phase considering the varying HT and the temporal change of dN/dh. Evolving dN/dh causes systematic refractivity biases, as it affects the beam trajectory, the associated target range, and the refractivity field sampled between selected targets of different heights. To determine HT and dN/dh changes, a twofold approach is proposed: first, HT can be reasonably inferred based on terrain height; then, a new method of dN/dh estimation is devised by using the property of the returned powers of a pointlike target at successive antenna elevations. The dN/dh obtained shows skill based on in situ tower observation. As a result, the data quality of the retrieved refractivity may be improved with the newly added information of dN/dh and HT.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
