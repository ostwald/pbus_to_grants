Results from 18 test simulations driven by steady upstream solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions are used to investigate the relationship between SW/IMF driving and low-altitude signatures of large-scale Alfvenic Poynting flux. When the IMF is southward, the intensity of the Alfvenic Poynting flux increases, and the hemispheric integrated Alfvenic Poynting flux exhibits a linear relation with the SW electric field. When the IMF has a B-y component, the simulated hemispheric Alfvenic power does not fit to the same linear relation. During steady IMF B-y driving conditions, the low-altitude regions with enhanced Alfvenic Poynting flux are magnetically connected with magnetospheric dynamo regions on both open and closed field lines. The physical origin of low-altitude Alfvenic Poynting flux connecting to the closed field line region is similar with that during southward IMF B-z driving. However, the Alfvenic Poynting flux flowing from the open field line dynamo region may be related to the physical process on the magnetopause, and only shear-mode waves are generated.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
