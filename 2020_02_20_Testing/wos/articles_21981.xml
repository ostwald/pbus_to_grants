Chamber experiments are however limited in number, performed under conditions that differ from the atmosphere and can be subject to potential artefacts from chamber walls. Here, the Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A) modelling tool has been used in a box model under various environmental conditions to (i) explore the sensitivity of SOA formation and properties to changes on physical and chemical conditions and (ii) develop a volatility basis set (VBS)type parameterization. The set of parent hydrocarbons includes n-alkanes and 1-alkenes with 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26 carbon atoms, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and limonene, benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene and p-xylene. Simulated SOA yields and their dependences on the precursor structure, organic aerosol load, temperature and NO, levels are consistent with the literature. GECKO-A was used to explore the distribution of molar mass, vaporization enthalpy, OH reaction rate and Henry's law coefficient of the millions of secondary organic compounds formed during the oxidation of the different precursors and under various conditions. From these explicit simulations, a VBS-GECKO parameterization designed to be implemented in 3-D air quality models has been tuned to represent SOA formation from the 18 precursors using GECKO-A as a reference. In evaluating the ability of VBS-GECKO to capture the temporal evolution of SOA mass, the mean relative error is less than 20 % compared to GECKO-A. The optimization procedure has been automated to facilitate the update of the VBS-GECKO on the basis of the future GECKO-A versions, its extension to other precursors and/or its modification to carry additional information.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
