Exner's analysis still stands today as an excellent description of the spatial structure of the leading pattern of atmospheric variability over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere (NH); namely, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Moreover, Exner provided an accurate commentary on regional changes in surface air temperature driven by NAO variability. His quantitative analysis of these aspects represented a major step forward in the history of research on NH climate variability that, prior to his study, was primarily qualitative.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
