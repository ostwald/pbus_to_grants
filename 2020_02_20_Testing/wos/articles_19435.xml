By definition, extreme temperatures are rare, and yet the theory of extreme value statistics has seldom been applied to quantify the influence of atmospheric blocking on hot spells. Similarly, a comparison of the relative influence of other well-known atmospheric drivers, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), has seldom been explored. We applied a novel combination of extreme value and geometric distributions to observed daily temperature maxima from 74 stations across Europe, covering 1951-2010, to establish a stationary model of the expected magnitude, frequency and duration of hot spells that did not explicitly account for atmospheric drivers. Monthly time series of NAO, ENSO and 4 coherent atmospheric blocking regions were then incorporated as non-stationary covariates in the distribution parameter estimates to assess the dependence of hot spells on atmospheric covariates. We concluded that ENSO does not have a significant influence on hot spell magnitude or frequency; the NAO is a significant driver of hot spell magnitude (maximum attained temperature), frequency (annual event count) and duration (length of event) in northern Europe and Atlantic bordering stations; and atmospheric blocking is a significant driver of all aspects of hot spells in all parts of Europe. While NAO may increase peak temperatures by 2-4 degrees C only in the north, relatively strong atmospheric blocking could result in increased temperatures of at least 4 degrees C higher across Europe, with a commensurate increase in hot spell duration of 2-4 d.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
