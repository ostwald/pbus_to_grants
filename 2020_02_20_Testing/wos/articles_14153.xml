The separation between the cold point tropopause (CPT) and lapse rate tropopause (LRT) heights is quantified in seasonal averages and with the frequency of occurrence. In seasonal averages, small separations, &lt;0.5 km, are found in the deep tropics, increasing to similar to 1 km toward higher latitudes and maximizing at similar to 1.5 km near the jet streams. The seasonal average separations show significant longitudinal structures in the December-January-February (DJF) and June-July-August (JJA) seasons. Case studies indicate that breaking Rossby waves and their effects extending into the equatorial region are responsible for the longitudinal structure in the DJF season. The seasonal average CPT-LRT separation therefore identifies the regions of the tropical upper troposphere-lower stratosphere that are controlled by extratropical forcing. Examination of individual profiles shows that a small yet significant fraction (similar to 12%) of temperature profiles has CPT-LRT separations of 1 km or larger in the region of small seasonal average separation. These large separations are produced by wave perturbations of the upper tropospheric temperature structure. The impact of tropopause separation on the cloud top-tropopause relationship is examined using colocated CALIPSO cloud top data. We find that the frequency of clouds above the tropopause is reduced by approximately 50% if the CPT is used instead of LRT. The occurrence of clouds above the CPT is nevertheless significant, especially over the western Pacific in the DJF season and over the Asian monsoon region in the JJA season.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
