However, emerging evidence suggests that some tropical ecosystems can exhibit tight N cycling, with low biologically available losses. In this study, we combined isotopic data with a well-characterized watershed N mass balance to close the N budget and characterize gaseous N losses at the ecosystem scale in a lowland tropical rainforest on the Osa Peninsula in southwestern Costa Rica. We measured delta N-15 and delta O-18 of nitrate (NO3 (-)) in precipitation, surface, shallow and deep soil lysimeters and stream water biweekly for 1 year. Enrichment of both isotopes indicates that denitrification occurs predominantly as NO3 (-) moves from surface soil down to 15 cm depth or laterally to stream water, with little further processing in deeper soil. Two different isotopic modeling approaches suggested that the gaseous fraction comprises 14 or 32% of total N loss (2.7 or 7.5 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)), though estimates are sensitive to selection of isotopic fractionation values. Gas loss estimates using the mass balance approach (3.2 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) fall within this range and include N2O losses of 0.9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Overall, gaseous and soluble hydrologic N losses comprise a modest proportion (similar to 25%) of the total N inputs to this ecosystem. By contrast, relatively large, episodic hydrologic losses of non-biologically available particulate N balance the majority of N inputs and may contribute to maintaining conservative N cycling in this lowland tropical forest. Similar patterns of N cycling may occur in other tropical forests with similar state factor combinations-high rainfall, steep topography, relatively fertile soils-such as the western arc of the Amazon Basin and much of IndoMalaysia, but this hypothesis remains untested.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
