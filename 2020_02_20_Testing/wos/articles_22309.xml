A bottom-up assessment begins with a model for the error in engineering measurements and propagates that error through the wind speed retrieval algorithm analytically. A top-down assessment performs a statistical comparison between CYGNSS measurements and coincident "ground truth" measurements of wind speed. Results of the two approaches are compared. Overall performance, as determined by the top-down method, is decomposed using the bottom-up approach into its contributing sources of error. Overall root mean square (RMS) uncertainty in the CYGNSS retrievals is 1.4 m/s at wind speeds below 20 m/s. At higher wind speeds, an increase in the retrieval error is primarily caused by a decrease in the sensitivity of the ocean scattering cross section to changes in wind speed. In tropical cyclones, retrieval errors are compounded by unaccounted departures from a fully developed sea state. Overall RMS uncertainty in the CYGNSS retrievals is 17% at wind speeds above 20 m/s.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
