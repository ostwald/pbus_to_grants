Jones et al. (2014) proposed that the tides induced a net transport of constituents themselves, in addition to the transport provided by the mean circulation induced by the dissipation of tides. Through diagnosis of the continuity equation for [O], our results show that the net meridional and vertical transport of O induced by the tides appreciably contributes to [O] changes in the lower thermosphere. Combined with recombination, these transport mechanisms drive a net reduction in [O] of similar to 25% that is transmitted to higher altitudes by molecular diffusion. The migrating diurnal tide appears to be the main driver of the [O] variations during September.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
