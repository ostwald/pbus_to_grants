Probabilistic forecasts produced from 10- and 30-member, 3-km ensembles were consistently better than forecasts from individual 1-km ensemble members. However, 10-member, 1-km probabilistic forecasts usually were best, especially over the first 12 h and at rainfall rates &gt;= 5.0mmh(-1) at later times. Further object-based investigation revealed that better 1-km forecasts at heavier rainfall rates were associated with more accurate placement of mesoscale convective systems compared to 3-km forecasts. The collective results indicate promise for 1-km ensembles once computational resources can support their operational implementation.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
