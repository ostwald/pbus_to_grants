The relative dispersion (epsilon), defined as the ratio between the standard deviation (sigma) of the cloud droplet size distribution and cloud droplet average radius (&lt; r &gt;), is a key factor in regional and global models. The relationship between epsilon and the clouds' microphysical and thermodynamic characteristics is examined. The results show that epsilon is constrained with average values in the range of similar to 0.25-0.35. epsilon is shown not to be correlated with cloud droplet concentration or liquid water content (LWC). However, epsilon variance is shown to be sensitive to droplet concentration and LWC, suggesting smaller variability of epsilon in the clouds' most adiabatic regions. A criterion for use of in situ airborne measurement data for calculations of statistical moments (used in bulk microphysical schemes), based on the evaluation of epsilon is suggested.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
