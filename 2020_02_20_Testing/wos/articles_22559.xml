The exposome drives genes x environment (GxE) interactions that can cause long-term latency and chronic diseases. The exposome constantly changes in response to external exposures and internal metabolism. Different types of compounds are found in different biological media. Objective: Measure polar volatile organic compounds (PVOCs) excreted in urine to document endogenous metabolites and exogenous compounds from environmental exposures. Methods: Use headspace collection and sorbent tube thermal desorption coupled with bench-top gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for targeted and non-targeted approaches. Identify and categorize PVOCs that may distinguish among healthy and affected individuals. Results: Method is successfully demonstrated to tabulate a series of 28 PVOCs detected in human urine across 120 samples from 28 human subjects. Median concentrations range from below detect to 165 ng/mL. Certain PVOCs have potential health implications. Conclusions: Headspace collection with sorbent tubes is an effective method for documenting PVOCs in urine that are otherwise difficult to measure. This methodology can provide probative information regarding biochemical processes and adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for toxicity testing.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
