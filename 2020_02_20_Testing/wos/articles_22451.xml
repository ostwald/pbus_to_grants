The LFM MHD simulations were performed using idealized solar wind conditions to produce BBFs. We show that BBFs can inject energetic electrons of few to 100 keV from the magnetotatail beyond -24 R-E to inward of geosynchronous, while accelerating them in the process. We also show the dependence of energization and injection on the initial relative position of the electrons to the magnetic field structure of the BBF, the initial pitch angle, and the initial energy. In addition, we have shown that the process can be nonadiabatic with violation of the first adiabatic invariant (mu). Further, we discuss the mechanism of energization and injection in order to give generalized insight into the process.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
