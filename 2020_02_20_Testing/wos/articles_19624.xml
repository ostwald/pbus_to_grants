However, significant studies on weather patterns associated with the airports and air routes of the Himalayan complex terrain and their implications for aviation activities are yet to be carried out. The present study numerically reconstructs the prevailing weather conditions and puts forward some possible causes behind the most recent fatal aircraft accident in the foothills of the western Nepal Himalaya at 0730 UTC (1315 LST) 16 February 2014. The weather patterns have been numerically simulated at 1-km(2) horizontal grid resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system. The reconstructed weather situation shows the existence of a low-level cloud ceiling, supercooled cloud water and hail, trapped mountain waves, supercritical descent of a strong tail wind, and the development of turbulence at the altitude of the flight path followed by the aircraft. The aircraft might have gone through a series of weather hazards including visibility obstruction, moderate turbulence, abnormal loss in altitude, and icing. It is concluded that the weather situation over the region was adverse enough to affect small aircraft and therefore that it might have played an important role leading to the fatal accident. The development of hazardous weather over the region may be attributed to a previously unanticipated large-scale easterly gravity current over the middle hills of the Nepal Himalaya. The gravity current originated from the central high Himalayan mountainous region located northeast of the Kathmandu valley and traveled more than 200 km, reaching the foothills of the western Nepal Himalaya.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
