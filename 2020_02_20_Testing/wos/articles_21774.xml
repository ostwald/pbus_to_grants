In this study, for the first time, we quantitatively investigate the posteclipse response of the global ionosphere and thermosphere system to the recent Great American Solar Eclipse using a high-resolution, global, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics model. It was found that the posteclipse response of the ionosphere and thermosphere is significant and worldwide, which was not expected. Specifically, even 9hr after the eclipse ended, the globally averaged ionospheric total electron content perturbations were about 0.2 total electron content unit, and the corresponding changes in neutral temperature and winds reached 2K and 2m/s. The changes in the global dynamic and energetic processes associated with the solar eclipse contributed to this long-lasting response of the ionosphere and thermosphere during the posteclipse period.</p><p>Plain Language Summary The thermosphere is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere above the mesosphere between about 60 and 1,000 km, and the ionosphere is the ionized part of the atmosphere. In this region, the neutral gas and the ionized plasma have significant impact on low Earth orbiting determination and satellite radio communications. This work is the first to use a state-of-the-art, first-principles model of the coupled thermosphere and ionosphere, with self-consistent electrodynamics, to systematically investigate the dynamics and electrodynamic behavior of the global ionosphere and thermosphere after an eclipse. Although the solar eclipse is a transient local event, its impact on the ionosphere and thermosphere can persist for a long time over the entire globe, rather than just being an impulse event with a localized response as was previously expected. This effort paves the way for improving the understanding of the upper atmospheric variability.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
