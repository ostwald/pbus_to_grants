However, this dayside equatorward wind was not reproduced by the standard Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model under the resolution of 5 degrees longitude by 5 degrees latitude (5 degrees x5 degrees). In this study, the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model has been run in different cases and under different resolutions to investigate the neutral dynamics around the cusp region. First, we compare the simulations with and without additional cusp energy inputs to identify the influence of cusp heating. Both runs have a resolution of 5 degrees x1 degrees (longitude x latitude) in order to better resolve the cusp region. After adding in the cusp energy, the meridional wind in simulation turns to be equatorward on the dayside, which is consistent with the observation. It indicates that strong heating in the cusp region causes changes in the pressure gradient around the cusp and subsequent variations in the neutral winds. The simulations with the same cusp heating specifications are repeated, but with different horizontal resolutions to examine the influence of resolution on the simulation results. The comparisons show that the resolution of 5 degrees x1 degrees can resolve the cusp region much more stably and consistently than the 5 degrees x5 degrees resolution.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
