We conducted simulations based on two scenarios: (1) an input flux that was a combination of atmospheric deposition and direct release from the F1NPP (combination-flux scenario) and (2) an input flux that took account only of the direct release of Cs-134 (single-flux scenario). The combination-flux scenario simulation successfully reproduced the distribution of Cs-134 activity observed in the surface layer from April 2011 to January 2014. The results indicate that Cs-134 deposited via atmospheric deposition into the Kuroshio-Oyashio Interfrontal Zone and Cs-134 directly released from F1NPP were both transported to south of the Subarctic Front around 42 degrees N in June of 2012. The combination-flux scenario suggests that the Cs-134 activities observed in the area north of 42 degrees N in 2012 originated from atmospheric deposition and that the Cs-134 activity was subducted in Central Mode Water during the winters of 2011 and 2012. We directly compared simulated and observed Cs-134 activities in the surface layer at 179 points across a wide area to the east of 155 degrees E from 2011 to 2013 to evaluate the accuracy of the two scenarios. The root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient, R, were 7.3 Bq m(-3) and 0.86, respectively, for the combination-flux scenario and 13.8 Bq m(-3) and 0.46, respectively, for the single-flux scenario, confirming that reproduction of the Cs-134 activity in the North Pacific after the F1NPP accident requires taking both fluxes into consideration. Based on a linear least squares regression between simulated and observed Cs-134 activity, the total Cs-134 flux into the North Pacific was estimated at 16.1 +/- 1.4 PBq. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
