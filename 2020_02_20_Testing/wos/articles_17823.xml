The migrating semidiurnal lunar tide, or M-2, is a global feature with amplitudes of about 10 m s(-1) at equatorial latitudes, and 20 m s(-1) at high latitudes. Amplitude maxima appear twice yearly, between February and April and between August and November. M-2 amplitudes during 2007-2008 are about 20% stronger than those during 2010-2011. These magnitudes are consistent with numerical predictions in WACCM-X. However, only one annual global-scale maximum is simulated during January-March. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
