In this article we consider a simple model of such flows with a nontrivial vertical structure, namely, two-layer quasigeostrophic flows, which remain amenable to analytical study. We obtain the statistical equilibria of the system in the case of a linear vorticity-stream function relation, build the corresponding phase diagram, and discuss the most probable outcome of nonlinear energy transfers, both on the horizontal and on the vertical, in the presence of stratification and rotation.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
