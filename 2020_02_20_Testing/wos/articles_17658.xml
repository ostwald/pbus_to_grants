Antisymmetric components with respect to the equator are dominant and are characterized by a vertical wavelength of similar to 15 km and a diurnal frequency. The temperature and vertical wind diurnal amplitudes in the stratosphere are 0.2-1 K and 1-7 mm s(-1), respectively. The latter is generally larger than the climatological ascent motion in the stratosphere. The observed latitudinal and vertical structures can be explained by the second, propagating, antisymmetric Hough mode. These tidal oscillations should be carefully considered in analyses of zonal mean fields at a particular universal time.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
