This study uses cloud-parameterized Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry simulations to analyze the subgrid deep convective transport of CO at 12- and 36-km horizontal resolution in supercell and mesoscale convective systems observed during the 2012 Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry field campaign and compares the simulation results with aircraft measurements and cloud-resolved simulations. The best Weather Research and Forecasting simulation of these storms was obtained with the use of the Grell-Freitas convective scheme. The default Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry subgrid convective transport scheme was replaced with a scheme to compute convective transport within the Grell-Freitas subgrid cumulus parameterization, which resulted in improved transport simulations. We examined the CO tendencies due to subgrid- and grid-scale convective transport. Results showed that the subgrid convective transport started earlier than the grid-scale convective transport. The subgrid- scale convective transport reached its maximum during the hour prior to the formation of the grid-scale constant- altitude detrainment layer. After that, both the subgrid- and grid-scale convective transport began to decrease. The subgrid- scale convective transport played a more significant role in the supercell case than the mesoscale convective system case. Subgrid contribution reached similar to 90% at the beginning of the storm and decreased to similar to 30% (17%) for the 36-km (12-km) domain 4 hr later.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
