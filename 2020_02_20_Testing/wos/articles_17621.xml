In part because of errors in these parameterizations, mesoscale ensemble data assimilation systems generally suffer from underdispersiveness, which can limit the quality of analyses. Two explicit representations of model error for mesoscale ensemble data assimilation are explored: a multiphysics ensemble in which each member's forecast is based on a distinct suite of physical parameterization, and stochastic kinetic energy backscatter in which small noise terms are included in the forecast model equations. These two model error techniques are compared with a baseline experiment that includes spatially and temporally adaptive covariance inflation, in a domain over the continental United States using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for mesoscale ensemble forecasts and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) for the ensemble Kalman filter. Verification against independent observations and Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) 13-km analyses for the month of June 2008 showed that including the model error representation improved not only the analysis ensemble, but also short-range forecasts initialized from these analyses. Explicitly accounting for model uncertainty led to a better-tuned ensemble spread, a more skillful ensemble mean, and higher probabilistic scores, as well as significantly reducing the need for inflation. In particular, the stochastic backscatter scheme consistently outperformed both the multiphysics approach and the control run with adaptive inflation over almost all levels of the atmosphere both deterministically and probabilistically.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
