Interpretations of these isotopic trends require quantitative estimates of the influence of climatic and environmental changes on delta O-18 and delta D of soil water. Here we use a coupled atmosphere-land model with water-iso-topologue tracking capabilities, ECHAM5-JSBACH-wiso, to simulate precipitation and delta O-18 responses to elevation-independent changes in Neogene geography, equator to pole temperature gradient (EPGRAD), grassland expansion, and tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. Both precipitation and soil water delta O-18 (delta O-18(sw)) respond strongly to Neogene strengthening of the EPGRAD, but weakly to other forcings. An increase in EPGRAD leads to significant drying and O-18 enrichment (3%-5%) of soil water over the northern Sierra Nevada and central Rockies as a result of Hadley circulation strengthening and enhanced coastal subtropical subsidence. These large-scale circulation changes reduce inland moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Our simulated delta O-18(sw) responses could explain 50%-100% of the proxy delta O-18 increases over the Sierra Nevada and central Rockies, suggesting that climate change rather than surface subsidence may have been the dominant climate signal in delta O-18 records in these regions. On the contrary, delta O-18 responses to climate changes are small in the Great Basin, indicating that the observed delta O-18 increase over this region was likely a direct response to surface subsidence with elevation losses of 1-1.5 km. Adding this elevation loss to current Great Basin elevations reveals the former existence of a uniformly high plateau extending from the Sierra Nevada to the central Rockies prior to Neogene extension. This revised elevation history brings Neogene delta O-18 and delta D paleoaltimetry of the western United States in accordance with independent lines of structural evidence and early Cenozoic elevation reconstructions.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
