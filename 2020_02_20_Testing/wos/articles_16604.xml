They then introduce a new generic method to quantify the scale predictability of the fractal atmosphere following the assumptions of the intrinsic inverse power law and the upscale cascade of error. The eddies (of all scales) are extracted against the instant zonal mean, and the ratio of noise (i.e., the domain-averaged square of error amplitudes) to signal (i.e., the domain-averaged square of total eddy amplitudes), referred to as noise-to-signal ratio (NSR), is defined as a measure of forecast skill. The time limit of predictability t(km) for any wavenumber k(m) = phi(m-1) can be determined by the criterion NSR(t(km)) = phi(-2m+2) = k(m)(-2) or by the criterion log(phi)[NSR(t(km))] = -2m + 2 = log phi(k(m)(-2)), where phi = (1 + root 5)/2 = 1.618 033 9887 ... is the golden ratio and m is a scale index. The NSR is flow adaptive, bias aware, and stable in variation (in a logarithm transformation), and it offers unique advantages for model verification, allowing evaluation of different model variables, regimes, and scales in a consistent manner. In particular, an important advantage of this NSR method over the widely used anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) method is that it could detect the successive scale predictability of different wavenumbers without the need to explicitly perform scale decomposition. As a demonstration, this new NSR method is used to examine the scale predictability of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) 500-hPa geopotential height.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
