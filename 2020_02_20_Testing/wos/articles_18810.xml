To shed light on links between climate and N cycling in tropical forests, we measured bulk surface soil C and N concentrations and isotopic content at 40 forested sites spanning an 1800 m elevation transect in Central America, possessing wide variation in mean annual temperature (MAT; range = 10 degrees C) and precipitation (MAP; range = 1.2 m). Climate and terrain attributes were extracted from gridded data sets and regressed against soil variables, and then, empirical relationships were combined with a mass balance model to scale up to the larger landscape. Across the remote study region, elevation and soil delta N-15 values displayed a strong negative relationship, while elevation was positively related to percent of soil C, N, and C: N ratios. As elevation was tightly correlated with MAT and MAP, soil chemical and isotopic content varied strongly with climate. For example, for every degree increase in MAT, soil delta N-15 values-an indicator of relative gaseous N losses-increased by a factor of 0.4, and soil C: N ratios, which affect net N mineralization and N availability, declined by a factor of 1.1. With the 40 sites binned into bioclimatic life zones, montane, premontane, and wet-premontane transition forests showed distinct clustering of soil chemical and isotopic properties, yet forest type alone explained less variation compared to continuous elevation-climate parameters. Results of the spatially applied N-15 mass balance model implied shifts in the contribution of gaseous-to-total N loss, from 10% or less in cool, wet high-elevation forests to upwards of 60% at warmer, drier, low-elevation sites. Climate variation was thus associated with significant shifts in N dynamics across this montane tropical region, yet more work is needed to decouple direct vs. indirect climatic controls. While the mechanisms deserve further study, observed shifts in indicators of N availability and gaseous loss may be useful in managing and modeling tropical forests under climate change.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
