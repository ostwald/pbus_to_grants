A primary objective of this study is to identify an effective method for correcting the effects of meteorology on July MDA8. We find significant correlations between July MDA8 O-3 and meteorological variables for sites in or near Denver, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah. The highest correlations were for 500hPa heights, surface temperatures, and 700hPa temperatures and zonal winds. We conclude that increased 500hPa heights lead to high July O-3 in much of the western U.S., particularly in areas of elevated terrain near urban sources of NO2 and other O-3 precursors. In addition to bringing warmer temperatures and fewer clouds, upper level ridges decrease winds and allow cyclic terrain-driven circulations to reduce transport away from sources. Because of strong, nearly linear responses of July MDA8 to 500hPa heights, it is not reasonable to use uncorrected trends in peak O-3 for assessments of the effectiveness of emissions controls for much of the western U.S. Robust linear regressions for July MDA8 and tropospheric NO2 with 500hPa heights can be used to assess and correct trends in July MDA8 in the Intermountain West.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
