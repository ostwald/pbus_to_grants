The model experiments use a range of planetary boundary layer parameterizations to quantify the uncertainty related to the turbulent closure assumptions and thus to isolate the dominant influence of the surface roughness formulation. Results indicate that a positive wind speed bias exists when common open-ocean formulations for roughness are adopted for a region with a water depth of 30m. Imposition of a wind stress formulation that is consistent with previous shallow-water estimates is necessary to reconcile model wind speeds with observations, providing modeling evidence that supports the increase of surface drag over shallow waters. The possibility of including water depth in the parameterization of roughness length is examined.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
