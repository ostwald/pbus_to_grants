The observed GPLLJ and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) relation undergoes seasonal changes with a stronger GPLLJ associated with La Nina in boreal spring and El Nino in boreal summer. The ability of the GFDL Forecast-Oriented Low Ocean Resolution (FLOR) global coupled climate model, which has the high-resolution atmospheric and land components, to simulate the observed seasonality in the GPLLJ-ENSO relationship is assessed. The importance of simulating the magnitude and phase locking of ENSO accurately in order to better simulate its seasonal teleconnections with the Intra-Americas Sea (IAS) is demonstrated. This study explores the mechanisms for seasonal changes in the GPLLJ-ENSO relation in model and observations. It is hypothesized that ENSO affects the GPLLJ variability through the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) during the summer and spring seasons. These results suggest that climate models with improved ENSO variability would advance our ability to simulate and predict seasonal variations of the GPLLJ and their associated impacts on the United States.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
