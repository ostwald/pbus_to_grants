The results show that the urban land-use change in East China causes spatially-varying changes in surface net radiation and heat fluxes, atmospheric circulation, and water budgets. It results in significant surface warming (cooling) and precipitation decrease (increase) in a large region north (south) of 30A degrees N. Urban expansion agglomerated in (29A degrees-41A degrees N, 110A degrees-122A degrees E) alters the surface energy budget and warms the surface, resulting in strengthened southwesterly airflow south of 25A degrees N and increased convergence below the mid-troposphere between 20A degrees and 30A degrees N. A concomitant northward downdraft associated with the increased convection generates an anomalous high pressure north of 30A degrees N. Meanwhile, the downdraft not only produces adiabatic warming but also inhibits the dynamic condition for precipitation formation. The anomalous high pressure formed in North China prevents the southwesterly airflow from advancing northward, leading to increase the convergence and precipitation in South China. These changes reduce the meridional temperature gradient in the mid-lower troposphere and weaken the westerly airflow near 30A degrees N. In addition, horizontal transport of vorticity north of 35A degrees N weakens significantly, which leads to an anomalous barotropic structure of anticyclonic there. As a result, the anomalous anticyclonic circulation and descent north of 30A degrees N are strengthened. At the same time, the anomalous cyclonic circulation and ascent south of 30A degrees N are enhanced. These process induced by the thermal state changes due to urbanization weakens the EASM.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
