The nightside electric potential satisfies an approximate minimization principle that unifies the connection of the horizontal and vertical components of plasma convection to the wind and conductivity distributions. The relative roles of E and F region conductivities on the convection and current closure are clarified. Evening time F region zonal winds at latitudes that encompass the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) region provide the main energy source to drive the convection, including the PRE. The E region helps regulate both the meridional and the zonal convection through drag on the meridional convection associated with Cowling current. For large nighttime E region conductivities, additional drag on the zonal convection comes from the Pedersen conductance. The minimization principle favors meridional plasma inflow to the EIA region from lower rather than higher magnetic apex heights, so long as the E region Cowling conductance is not too large. This upward/poleward inflow maximizes on field lines that traverse the lower F layer near the equatorward edge of the EIA region, producing a PRE with maximum vertical velocity within the equatorial F layer.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
