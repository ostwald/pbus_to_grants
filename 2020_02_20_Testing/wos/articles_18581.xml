Test category 1 examines the advective transport of passive tracers by three-dimensional prescribed wind velocity fields, on the sphere. These tests are applied to the Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), the default for high-resolution simulations in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Test case results are compared with results from the CAM-FV (Finite Volume) and MCore models where possible. This analysis serves both to evaluate the performance of CAM-SE's spectral-element tracer transport routines as well as to provide a baseline for comparison with other atmospheric dynamical cores and f or future improvements to CAM-SE itself.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
