Unfortunately, a comprehensive comparison between the different M-E codes available to the solar physics community is still missing, and so is a physical interpretation of their inferences. In this contribution we offer a comparison between three of those codes (VFISV, ASP/HAO, and HeLIx(+)). These codes are used to invert synthetic Stokes profiles that were previously obtained from realistic non-grey three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical (3D MHD) simulations. The results of the inversion are compared with each other and with those from the MHD simulations. In the first case, the M-E codes retrieve values for the magnetic field strength, inclination and line-of-sight velocity that agree with each other within sigma(B) &lt;= 35 (Gauss), sigma(gamma) &lt;= 1.2 degrees, and sigma(v) &lt;= 10 ms(-1), respectively. Additionally, M-E inversion codes agree with the numerical simulations, when compared at a fixed optical depth, within sigma(B) &lt;= 130 (Gauss), sigma(gamma) &lt;= 5 degrees, and sigma(v) &lt;= 320 ms(-1). Finally, we show that employing generalized response functions to determine the height at which M-E codes measure physical parameters is more meaningful than comparing at a fixed geometrical height or optical depth. In this case the differences between M-E inferences and the 3D MHD simulations decrease to sigma(B) &lt;= 90 (Gauss), sigma(gamma) &lt;= 3 degrees, and sigma(v) &lt;= 90 ms(-1).</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
