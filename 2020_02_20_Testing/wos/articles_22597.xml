There are 3 different emission sectors for O-3 precursors in the region, including anthropogenic VOCS and NOX emissions, ship emissions (mainly NOX), and biogenic emissions from a large forest (biogenic VOCS). This unique emission mixture produces complicated chemical processes in studying the O-3 pollutions in the region. This study aims to identify the contribution of the ship emissions to O-3 pollutions, as well as the effect of mixing emissions on O-3 pollutions in YRD. To identify the individual emission effect, the WRF-Chem model is used in this study. The model generally performs well in simulating meteorological parameters and air pollutants against observations in YRD. Sensitive study suggests that the ship emissions have important effects on the O-3 concentrations over ocean and inland, with a maximum increase of 30-50 mu g m(-3) occurred mainly in the ship track regions. However, the ship emissions have a very complicated effect on the in-land O-3 concentrations. In the north of Shanghai, the NOX concentrations are high due to high anthropogenic emissions, and a further increase in NOX emissions from ship results in depressing O-3 chemical production. In contrast, in the south of Shanghai, there are high biogenic VOC emissions (mainly isoprene) and low NOx concentrations. As a result, the O-3 concentrations are enhanced by 30-50 mu g m(-3), due to the mixing between ship and forest emissions. This study suggests that ship emissions play important roles in controlling O-3 pollutions in YRD. Furthermore, the mixing emissions between ship, anthropogenic, and biogenic emissions in YRD produce a complicated O-3 chemical production and need to be carefully considered in controlling strategy of O-3 pollution in the region.
