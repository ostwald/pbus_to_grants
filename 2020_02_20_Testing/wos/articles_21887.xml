Their wintertime concentrations have changed little in the past decade despite considerable precursor emissions reductions. The reasons for this have remained unclear because detailed observations to constrain the wintertime gas-particle chemical system have been lacking. We use extensive airborne observations over the eastern United States from the 2015 Wintertime Investigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) campaign; ground-based observations; and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to determine the controls on winter SO42- and NO3-. GEOS-Chem reproduces observed SO42--NO3--NH4+ particulate concentrations (2.45 mu g sm(-3)) and composition (SO42-: 47%; NO3-: 32%; NH4+: 21%) during WINTER. Only 18% of SO2 emissions were regionally oxidized to SO42- during WINTER, limited by low [H2O2 ] and [OH]. Relatively acidic fine particulates (pH similar to 1.3) allow 45% of nitrate to partition to the particle phase. Using GEOS-Chem, we examine the impact of the 58% decrease in winter SO2 emissions from 2007 to 2015 and find that the H2O2 limitation on SO2 oxidation weakened, which increased the fraction of SO2 emissions oxidizing to SO42-. Simultaneously, NOx emissions decreased by 35%, but the modeled NO3- particle fraction increased as fine particle acidity decreased. These feedbacks resulted in a 40% decrease of modeled [SO42-] and no change in [NO3-], as observed. Wintertime [SO42-] and [NO3-] are expected to change slowly between 2015 and 2023, unless SO2 and NOx emissions decrease faster in the future than in the recent past.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
