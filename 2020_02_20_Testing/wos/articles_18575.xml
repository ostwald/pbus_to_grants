On seasonal and interannual timescales, the variability of T-s determines the active-layer depth, which regulates hydrological soil properties and biogeochemical processes. On the multi-decadal scale, increasing T-s not only drives permafrost thaw/retreat but can also trigger and accelerate the decomposition of soil organic carbon. The magnitude of permafrost carbon feedbacks is thus closely linked to the rate of change of soil thermal regimes. In this study, we used nine process-based ecosystem models with permafrost processes, all forced by different observation-based climate forcing during the period 1960-2000, to characterize the warming rate of T-s in permafrost regions. There is a large spread of T-s trends at 20 cm depth across the models, with trend values ranging from 0.010 +/- 0.003 to 0.031 +/- 0.005 degrees C yr(-1). Most models show smaller increase in T-s with increasing depth. Air temperature (T-a) and longwave downward radiation (LWDR) are the main drivers of T-s trends, but their relative contributions differ amongst the models. Different trends of LWDR used in the forcing of models can explain 61% of their differences in T-s trends, while trends of T a only explain 5% of the differences in T-s trends. Uncertain climate forcing contributes a larger uncertainty in T-s trends (0.021 +/- 0.008 degrees C yr(-1), mean +/- standard deviation) than the uncertainty of model structure (0.012 +/- 0.001 degrees C yr(-1)), diagnosed from the range of response between different models, normalized to the same forcing. In addition, the loss rate of near-surface permafrost area, defined as total area where the maximum seasonal active-layer thickness (ALT) is less than 3m loss rate, is found to be significantly correlated with the magnitude of the trends of T-s at 1m depth across the models (R = -0.85, P = 0.003), but not with the initial total nearsurface permafrost area (R = -0.30, P = -0.438). The sensitivity of the total boreal near-surface permafrost area to T-s at 1m is estimated to be of -2.80 +/- 0.67 million km(2) degrees C-1. Finally, by using two long-term LWDR data sets and relationships between trends of LWDR and T-s across models, we infer an observation-constrained total boreal near-surface permafrost area decrease comprising between 39 +/- 14 x 10(3) and 75 +/- 14 x 10(3) km(2) yr(-1) from 1960 to 2000. This corresponds to 9-18% degradation of the current permafrost area.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
