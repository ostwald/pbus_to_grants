Using representative models for each environment we derive fundamental descriptions of the coupling of the constituent parts to each other and to the electric and magnetic fields, and we examine the variation in magnetization of the components. Using these descriptions we compare related phenomena in the two environments, and discuss electric currents, energy transfer and dissipation. We present examples of physical processes that occur in both atmospheres, the descriptions of which have previously been conducted in contrasting paradigms, that serve as examples of how the chromospheric and ionospheric communities can further collaborate. We also suggest future collaborative studies that will help improve our understanding of these two different atmospheres, which while sharing many similarities, also exhibit large disparities in key quantities.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
