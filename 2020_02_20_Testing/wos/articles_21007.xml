The data collected from a C-band, polarimetric Doppler radar (reflectivity Z, differential reflectivity Z(DR), and specific differential phase K-DP) and a disdrometer are used to investigate the variations of microphysical characteristics within the convective region during the formative, intensifying, and mature stages of the squall line. The microphysical characteristics of the squall line are noticeably different among these three stages. When the squall line develops from the formative stage to the mature stage, its radar-derived drop size distribution (DSD) in the convective region evolves from continental-like convection to more maritime-like convection. Contrary to previous studies, the DSD characteristics of a convective line may not be simply locked to a geographical location but varied extensively throughout its life cycle. The polarimetric radar-derived liquid water content below the freezing level in the convective region is 3 times higher than the ice water content above the freezing level. This, in conjunction with a low cloud base (similar to 0.68km) and a high freezing level (similar to 5km), indicates a deep warm cloud layer and the dominance of the warm rain process within this squall line.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
