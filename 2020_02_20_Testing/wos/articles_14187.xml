The O-3 tidal fields are extracted from the data by the same method as the temperature tides have been derived. The spatial distribution and seasonal variability of the three strongest nonmigrating O-3 tidal variabilities, i.e., SW3, DW2, and DE3, are shown. They demonstrate repeatable presence each year. These O-3 tidal variations have large amplitudes at the seasons and latitudes for which the respective temperature (T) tides amplify, i.e., near the equator and during the equinoxes. The phases of the T and O-3 tidal signatures are out of phase above 95 km. This phase relationship no longer holds for tidal perturbations below about 90 km. The O-3 SW3 and DW2 tidal variations have similar interannual variabilities that appear to follow El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability. The O-3 DE3 tidal field, however, has a clear biyearly interannual variability as the biyearly maxima correlate with the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation in tropical stratospheric winds but only up to 2008.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
