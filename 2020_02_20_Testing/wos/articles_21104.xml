The stars were observed with the Cosmic Origins UV Spectrographs on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on 2015 October 23 and 2016 February 3, respectively, and with the Chandra X-ray Observatory on 2016 February 7. Time-series data in Ca II data are used to place the UV data in context. The UV spectra of 18 Sco (3.7. +/-. 0.5 Gyr), the Sun (4.6. +/-. 0.04 Gyr), and a Cen A (5.4(-0.2)(+1.2) Gyr) appear remarkably similar, pointing to a convergence of magnetic heating rates for G2 main-sequence stars older than approximate to 2-4 Gyr. But the B component's X-ray (0.3-2.5 keV) flux lies 20x below a well-known minimum level reported by Schmitt. As reported for a. Cen. A, the coronal temperature probably lies below that detectable in soft X-rays. No solar UV flux spectra of comparable resolution to those of stellar data exist, but they are badly needed for comparison with stellar data. Center-to-limb variations are reevaluated for lines such as Ca II through X-rays, with important consequences for observing activity cycles in such features. We also call into question work that has mixed solar intensity-intensity statistics with flux-flux relations of stars.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
