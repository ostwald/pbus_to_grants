Model simulations suggest that the most active transport of VSLSs from the marine boundary layer through the tropopause occurs over the tropical Indian Ocean, the tropical western Pacific, and off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Together, convective lofting of CHBr3 and CH2Br2 and their degradation products supplies similar to 8 ppt total bromine to the base of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL, similar to 150 hPa), similar to the amount of VSLS organic bromine available in the marine boundary layer (similar to 7.8-8.4 ppt) in the active convective lofting regions mentioned above. Of the total similar to 8 ppt VSLS bromine that enters the base of the TTL at similar to 150 hPa, half is in the form of organic source gases and half in the form of inorganic product gases. Only a small portion (&lt; 10%) of the VSLS-originated bromine is removed via wet scavenging in the TTL before reaching the lower stratosphere. On average, globally, CHBr3 and CH2Br2 together contribute similar to 7.7 pptv to the present-day inorganic bromine in the stratosphere. However, varying model deep-convection strength between maximum (strongest) and minimum (weakest) convection conditions can introduce a similar to 2.6 pptv uncertainty in the contribution of VSLSs to inorganic bromine in the stratosphere (Br-y(VSLS)). Contrary to conventional wisdom, the minimum convection condition leads to a larger Br-y(VSLS) as the reduced scavenging in soluble product gases, and thus a significant increase in product gas injection (2-3 ppt), greatly exceeds the relatively minor decrease in source gas injection (a few 10ths ppt).</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
