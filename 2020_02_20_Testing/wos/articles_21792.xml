The LLT algorithm provides predictions of energy dissipation rate (EDR; turbulence dissipation to the one-third power), which is the standard turbulence metric used by the aviation community. The algorithm is based upon the use of distinct log-Weibull and lognormal probability distributions in a statistical remapping technique to represent accurately the behavior of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer for daytime and nighttime conditions, respectively, thus accounting for atmospheric stability. A 1-yr-long GTG LLT calibration was performed using the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh operational model, and optimum GTG ensembles of turbulence indices for clear-air and mountain-wave turbulence that minimize the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were determined. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm with in situ EDR data from the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory tower covering a range of altitudes up to 300m above the surface demonstrates a reduction in the error by a factor of approximately 2.0 (MAPE 5 55%) relative to the current operational GTG system (version 3). In addition, the probability of detection of typical small and large EDR values at low levels is increased by approximately 15%-20%. The improved LLT algorithm is expected to benefit several nonconventional turbulence-prediction sectors such as unmanned aerial systems and wind energy.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
