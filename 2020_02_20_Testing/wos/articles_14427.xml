Large-eddy simulations are analyzed to study the effects of ice habit and number concentration on the bulk ice and liquid masses, dynamics, and lifetime of Arctic mixed-phase boundary layer clouds. The microphysical and dynamical evolution simulated using the adaptive habit scheme is compared with that assuming spherical particles with a density of bulk ice or a reduced density and with mass-dimensional parameterizations. It is found that the adaptive habit method returns an increased (decreased) ice (liquid) mass as compared to spheres and provides a more accurate simulation as compared to dendrite mass-size relations.</p><p>Using the adaptive habit method, simulations are then completed to understand the microphysical and dynamical interactions within a single-layer mixed-phase stratocumulus cloud observed during flight 31 of the Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign. With cloud-top longwave radiative cooling as a function of liquid mass acting as the primary dynamic driver of turbulent eddies within these clouds, the consumption of liquid at the expense of ice growth and subsequent sedimentation holds a strong control on the cloud lifetime. Ice concentrations &gt;= 4 L-1 collapse the liquid layer without any external maintaining sources. Layer maintenance is possible at 4 L-1 when a constant cloud-top cooling rate or the water mass lost due to sedimentation is supplied. Larger concentrations require a more substantial source of latent or sensible heat for mixed-phase persistence.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
