Snow cover regulated the annual sum of primary productivity in the forest, and beneath-snow respiration represented a significant portion of ecosystem respiration at both locations.</p><p>Conclusions: Changes in the magnitude, timing, or spatial distribution of snow are likely to have the greatest impact on ecological processes in these semi-arid mountain catchments, but possibly in compensatory ways. Ultimately, the degree to which net carbon losses from alpine tundra offset forest carbon sequestration will determine the future magnitude of the Western United States carbon sink.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
