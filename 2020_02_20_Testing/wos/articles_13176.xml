DG methods coupled with strong-stability-preserving explicit Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) time discretizations provide a robust numerical approach suitable for geoscience applications including atmospheric modeling. However, a major drawback of the RKDG method is its stringent Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability restriction associated with explicit time stepping. To address this issue, the authors adopt a dimension-splitting approach where a semi-Lagrangian (SL) time-stepping strategy is combined with the DG method. The resulting SLDG scheme employs a sequence of 1D operations for solving multidimensional transport equations. The SLDG scheme is inherently conservative and has the option to incorporate a local positivity-preserving filter for tracers. A novel feature of the SLDG algorithm is that it can be used for multitracer transport for global models employing spectral-element grids, without using an additional finite-volume grid system. The quality of the proposed method is demonstrated via benchmark tests on Cartesian and cubed-sphere geometry, which employs nonorthogonal, curvilinear coordinates.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
