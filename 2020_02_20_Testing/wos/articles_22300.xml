However, the physical mechanisms behind this statistical inference have not been demonstrated conclusively. We show that such PILs can occur owing to the collision between two emerging flux tubes nested within the same AR. In such multipolar ARs, the flux tubes may emerge simultaneously or sequentially, each initially producing a bipolar magnetic region (BMR) at the surface. During each flux tube's emergence phase, the magnetic polarities can migrate such that opposite polarities belonging to different BMRs collide, resulting in shearing and cancellation of magnetic flux. We name this process "collisional shearing" to emphasize that the shearing and flux cancellation develop owing to the collision. Collisional shearing is a process different from the known concept of flux cancellation occurring between polarities of a single bipole, a process that has been commonly used in many numerical models. High spatial and temporal resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory for two emerging ARs, AR 11158 and AR 12017, show the continuous cancellation of up to 40% of the unsigned magnetic flux of the smallest BMR, which occurs at the collisional PIL for as long as the collision persists. The flux cancellation is accompanied by a succession of solar flares and CMEs, products of magnetic reconnection along the collisional PIL. Our results suggest that the quantification of magnetic cancellation driven by collisional shearing needs to be taken into consideration in order to improve the prediction of solar energetic events and space weather.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
