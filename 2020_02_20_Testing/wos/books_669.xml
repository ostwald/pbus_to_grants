Observations collected during the Satellite Applications for Arctic Weather and Search and rescue (SAR) Operations (SAAWSO) project that took place over Goose Bay, Newfoundland (NFL), Canada were studied to assess LSN characteristics and instrument sensitivities. Two case studies representing extreme environmental conditions temperature between 0 and -35 degrees C, and snow occurrence for the SAAWSO project are presented. The ice crystal size and shape of LSN using a new platform called Ground Cloud Imaging Probe (GCIP) were obtained between 7.5 and 930 mu m over 60 channels at 15 mu m intervals. The measurements from the GCIP, Laser Precipitation Monitor (LPM), weighing gauges, and OPWS were used in the analysis. The results suggested the following: (1) LSN occurs at about 80% of time over the Arctic regions; (2) LSN can play a significant role in cooling at the surface and dehydration of the upper levels; and (3) OPWS can respond to LSN conditions better than weighing gauges. It is concluded that OPWS and spectral probes can improve measurement of LSN, including snow particle shape and size distribution with sizes &lt; 0.5 mm. Further research on LSN impact on weather and climate simulations is needed.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
