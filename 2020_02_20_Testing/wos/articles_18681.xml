Fresh and aged anvil outflow (9-12 km) from supercells, mesoscale convective systems, mesoscale convective complexes, and squall lines were probed over Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kansas. For three case studies (30 May and 8 and 12 June) a combination of trace species, radar, lightning, and satellite information, as well as model results, were used to analyze and design schematics of major trace gas transport pathways within and in the vicinity of the probed thunderstorms. The impact of thunderstorms on the O-3 composition in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (LS) region was analyzed. Overshooting cloud tops injected high amounts of biomass burning and lightning-produced NOx emissions into the LS, in addition to low O-3 mixing ratios from the lower troposphere. As a dynamical response, O-3-rich air from the LS was transported downward into the anvil and also surrounded the outflow. The Delta O-3/Delta CO ratio was determined in the anvil outflow region. A pronounced in-mixing of O-3-rich stratospheric air masses was observed in the outflow indicated by highly positive or even negative Delta O-3/Delta CO ratios (+1.4 down to -3.9). Photochemical O-3 production (Delta O-3/Delta CO = +0.1) was found to be minor in the recently lofted pollution plumes. O-3 mixing ratios within the aged anvil outflow were mainly enhanced due to dynamical processes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
