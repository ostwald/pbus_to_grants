E x B drifts respond with different time delays in the dayside auroral zone and high-latitude polar cap with an initial 11 min transition state of oppositely directed E x B drifts coexisting at these locations. This is followed by a 6-8 min rotation of lower latitude E x B flow from dusk to dawn. We propose that this sequence of events is consistent with two separate X lines coexisting on the subsolar and lobe magnetopause. Time delays are proposed for merged flux of the draped preceding IMF to exit the subsolar region before the new IMF may be processed along a newly reconfigured component reconnection X line. Finally, a strong direct correlation is observed between magnetosheath plasma density and auroral zone E x B speeds.</p><p>Plain Language Summary It is often assumed that the ionosphere responds very fast to changes of the solar wind magnetic field in the dayside sector of the auroral zone. Here we show, for the first time, that this is not the case for very fast (5 s) rotations of the east-west component of the upstream solar wind magnetic field. It is very likely related to a processing delay of magnetic field reconnection at the Earth's outermost magnetic field boundary with the solar wind (aka magnetopause).</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
