We use a conservative averaging-reconstruction method (Ring Average) on structured cylindrical/spherical mesh to remove this severe time step restriction for multi-dimensional curvilinear finite-volume MHD solvers. The Ring Average technique is implemented as a post-processing step and thus requires no changes to the existing data structure, grid definition or numerical methods in the original MHD solver. This paper describes the Ring Average algorithm and presents simulation results using field loop advection and MHD blast waves in cylindrical/spherical geometries for validation. The algorithm is shown to be inexpensive and easily implemented in existing curvilinear finite-volume MHD solvers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.
