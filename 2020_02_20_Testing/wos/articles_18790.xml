These areas are reduced by applying additional terrain averaging, which damps out the unphysical components of small-scale (similar to 2x) energy aloft induced by unfiltered topography in the initialization of the WRF model. First, a control simulation with the same design of the WRF-RAP model shows that the large-scale atmospheric conditions are well simulated but predict strong turbulence over the western mountainous region. Four experiments with different levels of additional terrain smoothing are applied in the initialization of the model integrations, which significantly reduce spurious mountain-wave-like features, leading to better turbulence forecasts more consistent with the observed data.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
