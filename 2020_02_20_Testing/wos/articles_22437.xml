In this study, we examine its characteristics using long-term neutral wind observations at Syowa (69 degrees S, 39 degrees E) between January 2004 and July 2018. The analysis reveals terdiurnal tide being a significant tidal component in the Antarctica around solstices with distinct vertical structures. (1) Tides above 94 km has opposite climatological variation to that below 94 km. (2) The zonal and meridional wind components are 90 degrees phase shifted, with similar amplitude in most seasons. (3) The vertical wavelength is shorter in summer than in winter. Most of these features differ from those reported in the Arctic, indicating hemispheric asymmetry. Furthermore, the phase structure reveals a dominant upward propagating mode in local summer but superposition of more than one mode in other seasons. A downward propagating mode in winter above 95 km suggests Joule heating/ion drag as likely tidal sources from above, in addition to those from lower atmosphere. The nearly 15-year Syowa observations provide new constrains and benchmark for models that seek to understand terdiurnal tidal forcing mechanisms in polar regions.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
