Nearly 500 mm of rain, a third of the average annual rainfall, fell in six hours. Six people perished and millions of Euros in damages occurred. The synoptic-scale meteorological system moved across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Mediterranean generating floods that killed 5 people in Southern France, before moving over the Ligurian Sea and Genoa producing the extreme event studied here.</p><p>Cloud-permitting simulations (1 km) of the finger-like convective system responsible for the torrential event over Genoa have been performed using Advanced Research Weather and Forecasting Model (ARW-WRF, version 3.3).</p><p>Two different microphysics (WSM6 and Thompson) as well as three different convection closures (explicit, Kain-Fritsch, and Betts-Miller-Janjic) were evaluated to gain a deeper understanding of the physical processes underlying the observed heavy rain event and the model's capability to predict, in hindcast mode, its structure and evolution. The impact of forecast initialization and of model vertical discretization on hindcast results is also examined. Comparison between model hindcasts and observed fields provided by raingauge data, satellite data, and radar data show that this particular event is strongly sensitive to the details of the mesoscale initialization despite being evolved from a relatively large scale weather system. Only meso-gamma details of the event were not well captured by the best setting of the ARW-WRF model and so peak hourly rainfalls were not exceptionally well reproduced. The results also show that specification of microphysical parameters suitable to these events have a positive impact on the prediction of heavy precipitation intensity values. (C) 2013 The Authors.
