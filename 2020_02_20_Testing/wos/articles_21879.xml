This observed turning is opposite of the clockwise turning observed (and expected, based on theory) at higher altitudes. Using a mesoscale forecast model, the same study shows that it has the same hodograph behavior as found in the observations. The study further shows that the reason for this anomalous counterclockwise turning is the decoupling of the surface layer from the boundary layer after sunset and its recoupling after sunrise. The present paper presents a simple model for this behavior by extending a recent analytical model for the diurnal oscillation to include the surface-layer effect. In addition, selected solution features are analyzed in terms of several of the nondimensional input parameters.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
