Results show that the interior STC transport into the equatorial basin through 9 degrees S and 9 degrees N is well connected with equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) (9 degrees S-9 degrees N, 180 degrees-90 degrees W). The highest correlation at interannual time scales is contributed by the western interior STC transport within 160 degrees E and 130 degrees W. It is known that the ENSO recharge-discharge cycle experiences five stages: the recharging stage, recharged stage, warmest SST stage, discharging stage, and discharged stage. A correlation analysis of interior STC transport convergence, equatorial warm water volume (WWV), wind stress curl, and SST identifies the time intervals between the five stages, which are 8, 10, 2, and 8 months, respectively. A composite analysis for El Nino-developing and La Nina-developing events is also performed. The composited ENSO evolutions are in accordance with the recharge-discharge theory and the corresponding time lags between the above denoted five stages are 4-12, 6, 2, and 4 months, respectively. For stronger El Nino events, the discharge due to interior STC transport at 9 degrees N terminates earlier than that at 9 degrees S because of the southward migration of westerly winds following the El Nino peak phase. This study clarifies subsurface transport processes and their time intervals, which are useful for refinement of theoretical models and for evaluating coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model results.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
