Here we use radiative kernels to understand the influence of rapid adjustment processes on precipitation in climate models. Rapid adjustments are generally triggered by the initial heating or cooling of the atmosphere from an external climate driver. For precipitation changes, rapid adjustments due to changes in temperature, water vapor, and clouds are most important. In this study we have investigated five climate drivers (CO2, CH4, solar irradiance, black carbon, and sulfate aerosols). The fast precipitation responses to a doubling of CO2 and a 10-fold increase in black carbon are found to be similar, despite very different instantaneous changes in the radiative cooling, individual rapid adjustments, and sensible heating. The model diversity in rapid adjustments is smaller for the experiment involving an increase in the solar irradiance compared to the other climate driver perturbations, and this is also seen in the precipitation changes.</p><p>Plain Language Summary Future projections of precipitation changes are uncertain, both on regional and global scales. Understanding the climate models' diversity of precipitation change and how these models respond to various climate drivers, such as greenhouse gases and aerosols, is a key topic in climate research. Using sophisticated techniques, we quantify the processes altering precipitation changes on a short time scale and show that changes in the vertical profile of temperature, water vapor, and clouds contribute very differently to precipitation changes for various climate drivers. Our results show that model diversity in precipitation changes varies strongly between the climate drivers.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
