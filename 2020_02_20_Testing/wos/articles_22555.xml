With its relatively short record, however, questions have persisted regarding how well satellite-measured trends reflect the trends associated with forced or anthropogenic forcing. Masking the forced sea level rise in the altimeter record is the presence of unaccounted-for, naturally occurring variability. Here, a combined approach using models and observations is used to attribute a portion of the satellite-measured sea level record to natural variability. The agreement between the observations and models makes clear the quality of current models and their ability to realistically capture sea level variability. This paper shows a regional trend pattern where the influence of natural variability has been reduced, providing a clearer picture of how anthropogenic forcing may impact sea level arise around the globe.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
