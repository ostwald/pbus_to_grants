A comprehensive comparison between monthly average model results and available measurements yielded Pearson correlation coefficients (R) &gt;= 0.8 at &gt;= 5 sites (out of a total of eight) for elemental carbon (EC) and nine trace elements: potassium, chromium, zinc, iron, titanium, arsenic, calcium, manganese, and strontium in the PM2.5 size fraction. Longer averaging time increased the overall R for PM2.5 EC from 0.89 (I day) to 0.94 (1 month), and increased the number of species with strong correlations at individual sites. Predicted PM0.1 mass and PM0.1 EC exhibited excellent agreement with measurements (R = 0.92 and 0.94, respectively). The additional temporal and spatial information in the UCD_P model predictions produced population exposure estimates for PM2.5 and PM0.1 that differed from traditional exposure estimates based on information at monitoring locations in California Metropolitan Statistical Areas, with a maximum divergence of 58% at Bakersfield. The UCD_P model has the potential to improve exposure estimates in epidemiology studies of PM trace chemical components and health.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
