So far, it is ground-based GPS observations that have been used to estimate GPS satellite DCB. With the increased Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions in the near future, the real-time satellite DCB estimation is a crucial factor in real-time LEO GPS data applications. One alternative way is estimating GPS DCB based on the LEO observations themselves, instead of using ground observations. We propose an approach to estimate the satellite DCB based on Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) and Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) GPS observations during the years 2002-2012. The results have been validated through comparisons with those issued by Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE). The evaluations indicate that: The approach can estimate satellite DCB in a reasonable way; the DCB estimated based on CHAMP observations is much better than those on COSMIC observations; the accuracy and precision of DCB show a possible dependency on the ionospheric ionization level. This method is significance for the real-time processing of LEO-based GNSS TEC data from the perspective of real-time applications.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
