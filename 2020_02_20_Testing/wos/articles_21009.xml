Such resources can facilitate an understanding of the co-evolution of genes in the context of a genome mapped onto a phylogeny, of a protein structure, and of interactions within a pathway. A phylogenetically indexed gene family database, the adaptive evolution database (TAED), is presented that organizes gene families and their evolutionary histories in a species tree context. Gene families include alignments, phylogenetic trees, lineage-specific dN/dS ratios, reconciliation with the species tree to enable both the mapping and the identification of duplication events, mapping of gene families onto pathways, and mapping of amino acid substitutions onto protein structures. In addition to organization of the data, new phylogenetic visualization tools have been developed to aid in interpreting the data that are also available, including TreeThrasher and TAED Tree Viewer. A new resource of gene families organized by species and taxonomic lineage promises to be a valuable comparative genomics database for molecular biologists, evolutionary biologists, and ecologists. The new visualization tools and database framework will be of interest to both evolutionary biologists and bioinformaticians.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
