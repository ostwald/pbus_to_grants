This signature coincides with the wave activities in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region with a similar zonal structure and period, deduced from the temperature and wind observations from the Thermosphere Ionosphere and Mesosphere Electric Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. The vertical wavelength of this 6 day wave is estimated to be similar to 65 km, which enables it to propagate up into the lower thermosphere and therefore modulate the ionosphere through E region wind dynamo. The zonal wind perturbations of the 6 day wave maximize in the equatorial region with an amplitude of similar to 30 m/s and the meridional wind perturbations peak at middle latitudes with an amplitude of 15-20 m/s. The 6 day oscillation in TEC peaks at the geomagnetic equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) crests in both hemispheres with a deep minimum at the equator. The absolute TEC perturbationsmaximize at similar to 1400-1800 LT with an amplitude of similar to 9 (similar to 7) total electron content unit (TECU; 1 TECU = 10(16) m(-2)) in the southern (northern) hemisphere, which account for similar to 16% (similar to 10%) of the background TEC. Larger relative TEC perturbations of similar to 20% are found at 0200-0400 LT. The similar wave number-period spectra and the consistent temporal variations of the 6 day periodical signatures in both neutral atmosphere and ionosphere suggest a strong neutral-ion coupling through planetary wave.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
