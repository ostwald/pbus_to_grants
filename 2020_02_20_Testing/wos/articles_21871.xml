Thermospheric density during 2008-2009, at the benchmark 400-km altitude, was shown to be approximately 30% lower than the previous solar minimum during 1996, in observations and in model simulations. Ionospheric densities were also estimated to be lower, by 10% to 20%. However, earlier analyses using data from the global network of Global Navigation Satellite System receivers did not find any significant reduction in global mean total electron content. Recent work reexamining those data using a limited set of receivers, but with consistent processing, identified a 19% reduction (Emmert et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JA023680). In this study, we compare model simulations of the thermosphere-ionosphere system during the 2008-2009 solar minimum to its predecessor and estimate a 16% reduction in global mean total electron content. This is consistent with the neutral thermosphere density change seen in model simulations and in satellite drag observations. In the model simulations, the primary driver is a 10% reduction in solar extreme ultraviolet irradiance, with a smaller contribution from lower geomagnetic activity, and a very small decrement due to increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p><p>Plain Language Summary The Sun goes through 11-year activity cycles, best known with regard to the number of sunspots. At solar minimum, when sunspots mostly vanish, the extreme ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum also diminishes. This causes lower temperature and density in the ionosphere and upper atmosphere above 100 km, where the extreme ultraviolet radiation is absorbed. Past solar minimum periods have seemed basically similar with regard to extreme ultraviolet radiation, and other manifestations of solar activity. However, the solar minimum during 2008-2009 was longer and had fewer sunspots than its predecessor during 1996, or than any minimum period in the past century. The thermosphere was also lower in density, and the ionosphere also appeared to be lower in density, but there were some contradictory measurements. Recent reanalysis of ionospheric measurements found better agreement with the thermospheric measurements. Modeling studies attempting to explain the changes in the ionosphere and thermosphere have suggested that they were caused by a decrease of about 10% in solar extreme ultraviolet radiation. Here we show that the model results and the ionospheric measurements are now in good agreement. This demonstrates that solar minima are not all the same and may have implications for understanding the Sun during extended periods of very low activity.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
