The O-3 LWRE derived from the infrared spectral measurements by Aura's Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) show that the spatiotemporal variation of LWRE is relevant to relative humidity, surface temperature, and tropospheric O-3 column. The zonally averaged subtropical LWRE is similar to 0.2 W m(-2) higher than the zonally averaged tropical LWRE, generally due to lower water vapor concentrations and less cloud coverage at the downward branch of the Hadley cell in the subtropics. The largest values of O-3 LWRE over the Middle East (&gt; 1 W/m(2)) are further due to large thermal contrasts and tropospheric ozone enhancements from atmospheric circulation and pollution. Conversely, the low O-3 LWRE over the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (on average 0.4 W m(-2)) is due to strong water vapor absorption and cloudiness, both of which reduce the tropospheric O-3 absorption in the longwave radiation. These results show that changes in the hydrological cycle due to climate change could affect the magnitude and distribution of ozone radiative forcing.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
