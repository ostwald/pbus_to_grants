However, the inhomogeneous nature of the influence of the ASL on sea ice as well as its influence during critical periods of the sea ice annual cycle is not clear. In this study, we do a spatio-temporal analysis of links between the ASL and the sea ice during the advance and retreat periods of the ice over the period 1979-2013 focusing on the role of the meridional and zonal winds. We use the ERA-Interim monthly-averaged 500mb geopotential height and 10m wind data along with monthly Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentrations (SIC) to examine the seasonal and interannual relationships between the ASL and SIC in the Ross-Amundsen sea ice sector. To characterize the state of the ASL we use indices that describe its location and its intensity. We show that the ASL has preferred locations and intensities during ice advance and retreat seasons. The strength and direction of the influence of the ASL are not spatially homogeneous and can change from advance to retreat season and there are strong significant relationships between the characteristics of the ASL and SIC, within and across seasons and interannually.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
