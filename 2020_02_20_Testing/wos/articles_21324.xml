Perturbation solutions are found for the limit of large latitudinal wave number, a limit commonly used to maximize instability due to magnetic buoyancy. We find that at all middle and high latitudes vigorous rotational instability is induced by weak toroidal fields, particularly for high longitudinal wave number, even when the vertical rotation gradient is marginally stable without toroidal field. We infer that this instability will prevent much storage of toroidal fields in the tachocline at these latitudes, but could be responsible for the appearance of ephemeral active regions there. By contrast, the low-latitude vertical rotation gradient, opposite in sign to that at high latitudes, is not only stable itself but also prevents magnetic buoyancy instability until the peak toroidal field is raised above a threshold of about 9 kG at the equator, declining to zero where the vertical rotation gradient changes sign, at 32 degrees.3 in our model. Thus this rotation gradient provides a previously unnoticed mechanism for storage of toroidal fields until they amplify by dynamo action to order 10 kG, whereupon they can overcome the rotation gradient to emerge as sunspots. These results provide a new explanation for why sunspots are seen only at low latitudes. The purely rotational instability at latitudes above 50 degrees, even without toroidal fields, also suggests that the high-latitude tachocline should be much thicker, due to HD turbulence, than has been inferred for lower latitudes from helioseismic measurements.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
