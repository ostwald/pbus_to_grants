In all storms the wind is rather strong, such that the flow is unblocked. The sampled clouds are mixed phase, shallow, and generally produce snowfall over the mountain only. The 2D scatterers' mean motion in the vertical along-track plane below flight level is synthesized using one radar antenna pointing to nadir, and one 30 degrees forward of nadir. This yields instantaneous cross-mountain hydrometeor streamlines.</p><p>The dynamics of the orographic flow dominate the precipitation patterns across the mountain. Three patterns are distinguished: the first two contain small convective cells, either boundary layer (BL) convection or elevated convection, the latter likely due to the release of potential instability in orographically lifted air. In these patterns the cross-mountain flow is relatively undisturbed. Precipitation from BL convection falls mostly on the windward side but precipitation from elevated convection may fall mostly in the lee. The third pattern is marked by more stratified flow, often with vertically propagating mountain waves, and with strong, plunging flow in the lee, resulting in rapid clearing of the storm across the crest and occasionally a hydraulic jump. In this case, most snow tends to fall upwind of the crest, although a shallow, sublimating snow "foot" is often seen over the leeward slopes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
