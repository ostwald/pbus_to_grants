An Aerodyne cavity attenuated phase shift particle light extinction monitor (CAPS-PMex) was deployed to measure beta(ext) (at average relative humidity of 20 +/- 7 %) of submicron aerosols at lambda = 632 nm at 1 Hz. Data from a suite of gas-phase instrumentation were used to interpret beta(ext) behavior in various categories of air masses and sources. Extinction enhancement ratios relative to CO (Delta beta(ext) / Delta CO) were higher in aged urban air masses compared to fresh air masses by similar to 50 %. The resulting increase in Delta beta(ext) / Delta CO for highly aged air masses was accompanied by formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). In addition, the impacts of aerosol composition on beta(ext) in air masses under the influence of urban, natural oil and gas operations (O&amp;G), and agriculture and livestock operations were evaluated. Estimated non-refractory mass extinction efficiency (MEE) values for different air mass types ranged from 1.51 to 2.27 m(2) g(-1), with the minimum and maximum values observed in urban and agriculture-influenced air masses, respectively. The mass distribution for organic, nitrate, and sul-fate aerosols presented distinct profiles in different air mass types. During 11-12 August, regional influence of a biomass burning event was observed, increasing the background beta(ext) and estimated MEE values in the Front Range.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
