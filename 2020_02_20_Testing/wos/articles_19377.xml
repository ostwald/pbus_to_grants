Understanding the observed profile variability for these trace gases is useful for understanding the accuracy of the assumed profile shapes used in satellite retrieval algorithms as well as for understanding the correlation between satellite column observations and surface concentrations. The four campaigns of the DISCOVER-AQ mission took place in Maryland during July 2011, the San Joaquin Valley of California during January February 2013, the Houston, Texas, metropolitan region during September 2013, and the Denver-Front Range region of Colorado during July August 2014. Several distinct profile clusters emerged for the California, Texas, and Colorado campaigns for O-3, indicating significant variability of O-3 profile shapes, while the Maryland campaign presented only one distinct O-3 cluster. In contrast, very few distinct profile clusters emerged for NO2 during any campaign for this particular clustering technique, indicating the NO2 profile behavior was relatively uniform throughout each campaign. However, changes in NO2 profile shape were evident as the boundary layer evolved through the day, but they were apparently not significant enough to yield more clusters. The degree of vertical mixing (as indicated by temperature lapse rate) associated with each cluster exerted an important influence on the shapes of the median cluster profiles for O-3, as well as impacted the correlations between the associated column and surface data for each cluster for O-3. The correlation analyses suggest satellites may have the best chance to relate to surface O-3 under the conditions encountered during the Maryland campaign Clusters 1 and 2, which include deep, convective boundary layers and few interruptions to this connection from complex meteorology, chemical environments, or orography. The regional CMAQ model captured the shape factors for O-3, and moderately well captured the NO2 shape factors, for the conditions associated with the Maryland campaign, suggesting that a regional air quality model may adequately specify a priori profile shapes for remote sensing retrievals. CMAQ shape factor profiles were not as well represented for the other regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
