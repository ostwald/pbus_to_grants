Satellite measurements of tropospheric ozone are now beginning to provide the vertical resolution, length of record, and density of coverage needed for disentangling the factors that influence variability and trends. A recent study by Wespes et al. (2017), utilizing an 8year data set from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instrument (IASI) satellite instrument to perform a global scale, spatially resolved analysis of influences of geophysical drivers on tropospheric ozone variability, represents a key step toward understanding long-term changes in the distribution of tropospheric ozone and its corresponding impacts on air quality, chemistry, and climate.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
