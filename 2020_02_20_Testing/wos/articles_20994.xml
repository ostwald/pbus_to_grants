Forward trajectory simulations in previous studies have shown that much of the air within the ASM anticyclone can be trapped for up to two or three weeks, not only laterally but also vertically. Here, we investigate the locations of exit points for upper-tropospheric air trapped within the ASM anticyclone, especially the preferred tropopause-crossing locations, using a 3-dimensional trajectory model. Forward trajectory calculations show two-thirds of the air crosses the tropopause at the southern part of the anticyclone via upward diabatic transport. Furthermore, some air crosses at northern and eastern parts via isentropic shedding, but air crosses rarely through the center of the anticyclone. However, calculations also show that many stratospheric parcels within the anticyclone are traceable from the upper-tropospheric anticyclone. This implies they cannot break through the tropopause directly overhead but instead enter the stratosphere via other entry points.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
