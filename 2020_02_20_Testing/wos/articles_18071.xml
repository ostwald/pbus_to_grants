The team leveraged a reanalysis-derived database to estimate the wind and solar power resources and their interannual variability under current climate conditions (1985-2005). Then, a projected future climate database for the time range of 2040-69 was derived on the basis of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) regional climate model (RCM) simulations driven by free-running atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. To compare current and future climate variability, the team developed a baseline by decomposing the current climate reanalysis database into self-organizing maps (SOMs) to determine the predominant modes of variability. The current climate patterns found were compared with those of an NARCCAP-based future climate scenario, and the CRCM-CCSM combination was chosen to describe the future climate scenario. The future climate scenarios' data were projected onto the Climate Four Dimensional Data Assimilation reanalysis SOMs. The projected future climate database was then created by resampling the reanalysis on the basis of the frequency of occurrence of the future SOM patterns, adjusting for the differences in magnitude of the wind speed or solar irradiance between the current and future climate conditions. Comparison of the changes in the frequency of occurrence of the SOM modes between current and future climate conditions indicates that the annual mean wind speed and solar irradiance could be expected to change by up to 10% (increasing or decreasing regionally).</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
