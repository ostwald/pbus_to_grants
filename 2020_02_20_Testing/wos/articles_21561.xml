It is most often used to lower I/O and storage costs, and sometimes to lower in-memory data size as well. With this paper, we consider five categories of data reduction techniques based on their information loss: (1) truly lossless, (2) near lossless, (3) lossy, (4) mesh reduction and (5) derived representations. We then survey available techniques in each of these categories, summarize their properties from a practical point of view and discuss relative merits within a category. We believe, in total, this work will enable simulation scientists and visualization/data analysis scientists to decide which data reduction techniques will be most helpful for their needs.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
