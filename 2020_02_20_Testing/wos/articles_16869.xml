In this study, convective momentum transport (CMT) associated with the MJO is analyzed based on the NOAA Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). A three-layer vertical structure associated with the MJO, as previously suggested in the mesoscale momentum tendency profile based on global cloud-resolving model simulations, is evident in the subgrid-scale momentum tendency from the CFSR. Positive (negative) subgrid-scale momentum tendency anomalies are found near the surface, negative (positive) anomalies are found in the low to midtroposphere, and positive (negative) anomalies in the upper troposphere are found within and to the west (east) of the MJO convection. This tends to damp the MJO circulation in the free atmosphere, while enhancing MJO winds near the surface. In addition, it could also reduce the MJO eastward propagation speed and lead to the backward tilt with height in the observed MJO structure through a secondary circulation near the MJO center. Further analyses illustrate that this three-layer vertical structure in subgrid-scale momentum tendency largely balances the grid-scale momentum transport of the zonal wind component u, mainly through the transport of seasonal mean u by the MJO-scale vertical motion. Synoptic-scale systems, which were previously proposed to be essential for the u-momentum transport of the MJO, however, are found to play a minor role for the total grid-scale momentum tendency. The above momentum tendency structure is also confirmed with the ECMWF analysis for the Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC) that lends confidence to these above results based on the CFSR.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
