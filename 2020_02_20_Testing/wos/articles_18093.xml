This is a curious result, first because most bomb plasma pressures p (the largest reported case exceeds 10(3) dyn cm(-2)) fall well below photospheric pressures (&gt; 7 x 10(3)), and second, UV radiation cannot easily escape from the photosphere. In the present paper the IRIS data is independently analyzed. I find that the bombs arise from plasma originally at pressures between &lt;= 80 and 800 dyne cm(-2) before explosion, i.e., between &gt;= 850 and 550 km above tau(500) = 1. This places the phenomenon's origin in the low-mid chromosphere or above. I suggest that bomb spectra are more compatible with Alfvenic turbulence than with bidirectional reconnection jets.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
