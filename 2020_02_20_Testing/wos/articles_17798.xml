The whole air samples collected with a frequency of 3 samples per week during April 2009-December 2011 are analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). Additionally, samples were collected from two semi-urban sites (Haldwani and Pantnagar) in the adjoining Indo Gangetic plain region. CH4 and NMHCs show a distinct seasonal cycle over this region with more frequent observations of higher levels during winter (DJF) and late autumn (SON) and lower levels during the summer-monsoon (JJA). Different NMHCs exhibit better correlations during autumn/winter as compared to the summer-monsoon season. The annual mean mixing ratios of methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, i-butane, n-butane, acetylene, and i-pentane at Nainital are measured to be 1.9 +/- 0.1 ppmv, 1.8 +/- 1.0, 0.7 +/- 0.9, 0.6 +/- 0.8, 0.6 +/- 0.7, 0.6 +/- 0.7, 0.5 +/- 0.6, 1.0 +/- 0.8, and 0.5 +/- 0.6, respectively (all in ppbv). The seasonal cycle of CH4 at Nainital is found to be similar to other global high altitude sites (jungfraujoch and Mauna Loa) but somewhat different than a high altitude site Mt. Abu in India. NMHCs, other than ethane and propane, are found to be higher over this central Himalayan region than other sites. Additionally, composition of NMHCs is shown to be different over the study region when compared with other sites in the IGP region. A correlation study between ln((n-butane)/(ethane)) and In((i-butane)/(ethane)) showed that oxidation by the OH radical is the main removal mechanism of these species over the central Himalaya and dilution maintains the ratios of these species. The lowest slope of propane and acetylene with CO during summer and spring are indicating absence of fresh air mass over this region. This study fills a major gap in observational data for light NMHCs in the Himalayas and has implications for better understanding of tropospheric chemistry over this region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
