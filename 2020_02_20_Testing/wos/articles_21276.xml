We find that the presence and spatial distribution of the warm pool, and not land-sea temperature differences, are the primary forcing agents for the monsoon. The land-sea temperature gradient, as a monsoonal mechanism, is tested by eliminating the Cathyasian peninsula and is found to have little impact on the spatial character of the monsoon. Furthermore, the response of the monsoon to the warm pool was tested by removing all Paleo-Tethys equatorial islands, which allows the warm pool to expand and migrate westward thus shifting the pattern of monsoonal precipitation. Given that paleogeography changes through time, these results have important implications for the migration and strength of the tropical monsoon over geologic time. Additionally, different CO2 regimes are presented, in which a 10-fold change in forcing produces diverging climates and therefore different warm pool and monsoon locales. Tropical and equatorial ocean currents impact the seasonal progression and location of the warm pool and atmospheric mass flux for the monsoonal regime is characterized and shown to change with warm pool movement. Experiments were conducted using the low-resolution version of Community Climate System Model, Version 3 (CCSM3) in both coupled and fixed sea surface temperature (SST) context. For validation purposes, a modern control is briefly presented with observations and is shown to represent both the spatial and seasonal progression of the Indian monsoon.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
