To assess the stratocumulus (Sc) to cumulus (Cu) transition (STCT), the observations are used to evaluate two versions of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5), both the base model and a version that has implemented a new subgrid low cloud parameterization, Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB).</p><p>The ratio of moist static energy (MSE) at 700-1000 hPa (MSEtotal) is a skillful predictor of median CF of screened low cloud grids. Values of MSEtotal less than 1.00 represent either conditionally or absolutely unstable layers, and probability density functions of CF suggest a preponderance of either trade Cu (median CF &lt; 0.4) or transitional Sc clouds (0.4 &lt; CF &lt; 0.9). With increased stability (MSEtotal &gt; 1.00), an abundance of overcast or nearly overcast low clouds exists. While both MODIS and ERA-Interim indicate a fairly smooth transition between the low cloud regimes, CAM5-Base simulates an abrupt shift from trade Cu to Sc, with trade Cu covering both too much area and occurring over excessively strong stabilities. In contrast, CAM-CLUBB simulates a smoother trade Cu to Sc transition (CTST) as a function of MSEtotal, albeit with too extensive coverage of overcast Sc in the primary northeastern Pacific subsidence region. While the overall CF distribution in CAM-CLUBB is more realistic, too few transitional clouds are simulated for intermediate MSEtotal compared to observations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
