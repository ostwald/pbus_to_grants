This paper evaluates the utility of model time tendencies, averaged over many forecasts at a given lead time, to diagnose systematic forecast biases in the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model during the 2010 North Atlantic hurricane season using continuously cycled ensemble data assimilation (DA). Erroneously strong low-level heating originates from the planetary boundary layer parameterization as a consequence of using fixed sea surface temperatures, impacting the upward surface sensible heat fluxes. Warm temperature bias is observed with a magnitude 0.5 K in a deep tropospheric layer centered &lt;700 hPa, originating primarily from the Kain-Fritsch convective parameterization.This study is the first to diagnose systematic forecast bias in a limited-area mesoscale model using its forecast tendencies. Unlike global models where relatively fewer time steps typically encompass a DA cycling period, averaging all short-term forecast tendencies can require potentially large data. It is shown that 30-min averaging intervals can sufficiently represent the systematic model bias in this modeling configuration when initializing forecasts from an ensemble member that is generated using a DA system with an identical model configuration. However, the number of time steps before model error begins to dominate initial condition (IC) errors may vary between modeling configurations. Model and IC error are indistinguishable in short-term forecasts when initialized from the ensemble mean, a global analysis from a different model, and an ensemble member using a different parameterization.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
