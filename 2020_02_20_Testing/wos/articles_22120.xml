A Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) and Vertical Incidence Pulsed Ionospheric Radar (VIPIR) were installed in 2014 and 2015 respectively, for simultaneous observations of neutral atmosphere and ionosphere in the polar region. Neutral winds observed by FPI show typical diurnal and semi-diurnal variations at around 250 km and 87 km respectively. VIPIR observations for the ionosphere also show typical electron density distributions in the polar region. Unlike conventional ionospheric sounder, it can measure ionospheric tilts to provide horizontal gradients of electron density over JBS in addition to general ionospheric parameters from sounding observation. In this article, we briefly report the preliminary results of the observations for the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere in the polar cap region.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
