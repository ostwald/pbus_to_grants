The setup follows the case of daytime convective development over land based on observations during the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere (LBA) experiment in Amazonia. In contrast to previous simulations with single-moment microphysics schemes and in agreement with results from bin microphysics simulations by others, the impact of pollution simulated by the double-moment scheme is large for the upper-tropospheric convective anvils that feature higher cloud fractions in polluted conditions. The increase comes from purely microphysical considerations: namely, the increased cloud droplet concentrations in polluted conditions leading to the increased ice crystal concentrations and, consequently, smaller fall velocities and longer residence times. There is no impact on convective dynamics above the freezing level and thus no convective invigoration. Polluted deep convective clouds precipitate about 10% more than their pristine counterparts. The small enhancement comes from smaller supersaturations below the freezing level and higher buoyancies inside polluted convective updrafts with velocities between 5 and 10 m s(-1). The simulated supersaturations are large, up to several percent in both pristine and polluted conditions, and they call into question results from deep convection simulations applying microphysical schemes with saturation adjustment. Sensitivity simulations show that the maximum supersaturations and the upper-tropospheric anvil cloud fractions strongly depend on the details of small cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that can be activated in strong updrafts above the cloud base.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
