Building on this remarkable accomplishment, the COP21 agreement marks a historic turning point for climate research by calling for actionable regional climate change information on time scales from seasonal to centuries for the benefit of humanity and the full biosphere. Out of the underlying United National Framework Convention on climate Change process, improving seamless regional climate forecast capabilities emerges as a closely linked challenge for the international research community. Addressing this challenge requires a multiscale approach to climate predictions. Here we offer a vision for realizing an approach that emphasizes enhanced scientific understanding of regional to local climate processes as the foundation for progress. The scientific challenge is extreme due to the rich complexity of interactions and feedbacks between regional and global processes, each of which affects the global climate trajectory. Technical development, international coordination, and a close interaction between the science and stakeholder communities are also required. In their absence scientific insight cannot be gained or turned into actionable climate information.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
