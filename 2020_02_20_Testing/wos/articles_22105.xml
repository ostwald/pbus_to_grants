The time delays of in situ electron density changes obtained from the CHAMP satellite in response to 27-day solar EUV flux changes vary from 0 to about 3 days. Meanwhile, the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model simulations driven by the measured EUV flux and the actual geomagnetic activity show similar time delays as those observed in the CHAMP measurements. Further simulations reveal that the geomagnetic activity greatly affects the determination of the ionospheric time delay to the 27-day solar EUV flux variations. Besides, the solar zenith angle change within the solar rotation interval can cause large latitudinal differences in the time delay. The ionospheric time delay to the pure 27-day solar EUV flux variation is less than 1 day and slightly increases with latitude, when geomagnetic activity and seasonal variations are eliminated in the simulation. The simulation results further suggest that the ionospheric response time is associated with the photochemical, dynamic, and electrodynamic processes in the ionosphere-thermosphere system.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
