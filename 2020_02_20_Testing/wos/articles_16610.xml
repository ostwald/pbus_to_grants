Including a model-error representation leads to significant increases in forecast skill near the surface as measured by the Brier score. Combining multiple model-error schemes results in the best-performing ensemble systems, indicating that current model error is still too complex to be represented by a single scheme alone.</p><p>To understand the reasons for the improved performance, it is examined whether model-error representations increase skill merely by increasing the reliability and reducing the bias-which could also be achieved by postprocessing-or if they have additional benefits. Removing the bias results overall in the largest skill improvement. Forecasts with model-error schemes continue to have better skill than without, indicating that their benefit goes beyond bias reduction.</p><p>Decomposing the Brier score into its components reveals that, in addition to the spread-sensitive reliability, the resolution component is significantly improved. This indicates that the benefits of including a model-error representation go beyond increasing reliability. This is further substantiated when all forecasts are calibrated to have similar spread. The calibrated ensembles with model-error schemes consistently outperform the calibrated control ensemble.</p><p>Including a model-error representation remains beneficial even if the ensemble systems are calibrated and/or debiased. This suggests that the merits of model-error representations go beyond increasing spread and removing the mean error and can account for certain aspects of structural model uncertainty.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
