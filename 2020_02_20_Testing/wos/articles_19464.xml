In the experiments, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter is applied and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperature TB observations are assimilated into an RA system composed of the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM4); radiative transfer models (RTMs); and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The performance of two snowpack RTMs, the DenseMedia Radiative Transfer-Multi-Layers model (DMRT-ML), and the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) in improving snow depth estimates through RA is compared. Continental-scale snow estimates are enhanced through RA by using AMSR-E TB at the 18.7- and 23.8-GHz channels [3%(DMRT-ML) and 2%(MEMLS) improvements compared to the cases using the 18.7- and 36.5-GHz channels] and by considering the vegetation single-scattering albedo v [2.5% (DMRT-ML) and 4.8% (MEMLS) improvements compared to the cases neglecting v]. The contribution of TB of the vegetation canopy to TB at the top of the atmosphere is better represented by consideringv in the RA system, and improvements in the resulting snow depth are evident for the forest land-cover type (about 5%-11%) and the taiga and alpine snow classes (about 5%-11% and 4%-8%, respectively), especially in the MEMLS case. Compared to the open-loop run (0.171-m snow depth RMSE), about 7% (DMRT-ML) and 10% (MEMLS) overall improvements of the RA performance are achieved.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
