This issue is most often discussed in terms of how well the models simulate the current (and past) climates. Most recently, in a chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group I Report, the authors indicated that the climate community does not know how to weight models for determining the best possible projections of future climate. This is certainly true for both global climate models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs). Given the potential importance of regional projections for developing adaptation plans, it behooves us to consider approaches toward model evaluation that depart from standard quantitative methods that have failed to clearly distinguish among different model simulations. To that end, we embarked on the study reported here.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
