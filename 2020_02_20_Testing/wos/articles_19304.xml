Here we quantify how much and by what mechanisms the North American ice sheet could have contributed to Meltwater Pulse 1a, by driving an ice sheet model with two transient climate simulations of the last 21,000years. Ice sheet perturbed physics ensembles were run to account for model uncertainties, constraining ice extent and volume with reconstructions of 21,000years ago to present. We determine that the North American ice sheet produced 3-4m global mean sea level rise in 340years due to the abrupt BOlling warming, but this response is amplified to 5-6m when it triggers the ice sheet saddle collapse.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
