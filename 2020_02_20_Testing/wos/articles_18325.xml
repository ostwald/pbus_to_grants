The verifying observation from each match is then used as an ensemble member. For at least some applications, the advantages of AnEn over an NWP ensemble (multiple real-time model runs) may include higher efficiency, avoidance of initial condition and model perturbation challenges, and little or no need for postprocessing calibration. While AnEn can capture flow-dependent error growth, it may miss aspects of error growth that can be represented dynamically by the multiple real-time model runs of an NWP ensemble. To combine the strengths of the AnEn and NWP ensemble approaches, a hybrid ensemble (HyEn) is constructed by finding m analogs for each member of a small n-member NWP ensemble, to produce a total of m x n members. Forecast skill is compared between the AnEn, HyEn, and an NWP ensemble calibrated using logistic regression. The HyEn outperforms the other approaches for probabilistic 2-m temperature forecasts yet underperforms for 10-m wind speed. The mixed results reveal a dependence on the intrinsic skill of the NWP members employed. In this study, the NWP ensemble is underspread for both 2-m temperature and 10-m winds, yet displays some ability to represent flow-dependent error for the former and not the latter. Thus, the HyEn is a promising approach for efficient generation of high-quality probabilistic forecasts, but requires use of a small, and at least partially functional, NWP ensemble.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
