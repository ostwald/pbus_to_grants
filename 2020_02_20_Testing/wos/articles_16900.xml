This procedure incorporates the observations and their errors, as well as two background models and their error covariances (estimated through empirical orthogonal function analysis) to infer complete distributions of electrostatic potential and vector magnetic potential in the high-latitude ionosphere. The assimilative technique also enables objective error analysis of the results. Various methods of specifying height-integrated ionospheric conductivity, which is required by the procedure, are implemented and evaluated quantitatively. The benefits of using both SuperDARN and AMPERE data to solve for both electrostatic and vector magnetic potentials, rather than using the data sets independently or solving for just electrostatic potential, are demonstrated. Specifically, solving for vector magnetic potential improves the specification of field-aligned currents (FACs), and using both data sets together improves the specification of features in regions lacking one type of data (SuperDARN or AMPERE). Additionally, using the data sets together results in a better correspondence between large-scale features in the electrostatic potential distribution and those in the FAC distribution, as compared to using SuperDARN data alone to infer electrostatic potential and AMPERE data alone to infer FACs. Finally, the estimated uncertainty in the results decreases by typically approximate to 20% when both data sets rather than just one are included.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
