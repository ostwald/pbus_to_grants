Results are presented demonstrating that WACCMX+DART analysis fields reproduce the middle and upper atmosphere variability during the 2009 major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. Compared to specified dynamics WACCMX, which constrains the meteorology by nudging toward an external reanalysis, the large-scale dynamical variability of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere is improved in WACCMX+DART. This leads to WACCMX+DART better representing the downward transport of chemical species from the mesosphere into the stratosphere following the SSW. WACCMX+DART also reproduces most aspects of the observed variability in ionosphere total electron content and equatorial vertical plasma drift during the SSW. Hindcast experiments initialized on 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 January are used to assess the middle and upper atmosphere predictability in WACCMX+DART. A SSW, along with the associated middle and upper atmosphere variability, is initially predicted in the hindcast initialized on 15 January, which is approximate to 10days prior to the warming. However, it is not until the hindcast initialized on 20 January that a major SSW is forecast to occur. The hindcast experiments reveal that dominant features of the total electron content can be forecasted approximate to 10-20days in advance. This demonstrates that whole atmosphere models that properly account for variability in lower atmosphere forcing can potentially extend the ionosphere-thermosphere forecast range.</p><p>Plain Language Summary Whole atmosphere models offer the opportunity to improve specification and forecasting of the upper atmosphere through incorporating the effects of forcing from both the lower atmosphere as well as the Sun. This study presents initial results from a data assimilation version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtended version (WACCMX+DART). WACCMX extends from the surface to approximate to 500km altitude and thus simultaneously models the lower, middle, and upper atmospheres. By assimilating meteorological observations in the troposphere-stratosphere, and satellite observations in the mesosphere, WACCMX+DART reanalysis fields are shown to reproduce the ionosphere variability during the 2009 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event. The ionosphere predictability during the 2009 SSW event is also assessed through a series of hindcast experiments that are initialized approximately 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0days prior to the central (i.e., peak) date of the SSW. The hindcast experiments reveal that for the 2009 SSW event, the middle and upper atmosphere variability can be qualitatively forecasted 10-20days in advance. The results demonstrate that it is possible to extend the useful forecast range of the ionosphere-thermosphere through incorporating lower atmosphere effects, at least during periods of quiescent solar activity.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
