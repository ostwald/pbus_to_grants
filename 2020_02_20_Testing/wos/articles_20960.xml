This study analyzes the deep convective transport in three different convective regimes from the 2012 Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry field campaign: 21 May Alabama air mass thunderstorms, 29 May Oklahoma supercell severe storm, and 11 Junemesoscale convective system (MCS). Lightning data assimilation within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) is utilized to improve the simulations of storm location, vertical structure, and chemical fields. Analysis of vertical flux divergence shows that deep convective transport in the 29 May supercell case is the strongest per unit area, while transport of boundary layer insoluble trace gases is relatively weak in the MCS and air mass cases. The weak deep convective transport in the strong MCS is unexpected and is caused by the injection into low levels of midlevel clean air by a strong rear inflow jet. In each system, the magnitude of tracer vertical transport is more closely related to the vertical distribution of mass flux density than the vertical distribution of trace gas mixing ratio. Finally, the net vertical transport is strongest in high composite reflectivity regions and dominated by upward transport.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
