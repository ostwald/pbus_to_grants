The Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory Large Coronagraph (COSMO LC) is a proposed 1.5m aperture coronagraph designed to synoptically observe magnetic fields and plasma properties in the large-scale corona to improve our understanding of solar processes that cause space weather. The LC will observe coronal emission lines over the wavelength range from 500 to 1100nm with a field of view of 1 degrees and a spatial resolution of 2arcsec. A spectral resolution greater than 8000 over the wavelength range is needed to resolve the polarization signatures of magnetic fields in the emission line profiles. The aperture and field of view of the LC set an etendue requirement of 1.39m(2)deg(2) for the postfocus instrumentation. We find that a tunable wide-field birefringent filter using Lithium Niobate crystals can meet the etendue and spectral resolution requirements for the LC spectrometer. We have tested a number of commercially available crystals and verify that crystals of the required size and birefringence uniformity are available. We also evaluate electro-optical tuning of a Lithium Niobate birefringent filter by the application of high voltage. This tunable filter represents a key enabling technology for the COSMO LC.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
