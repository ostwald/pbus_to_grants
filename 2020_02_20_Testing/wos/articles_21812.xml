The AnEn is an inexpensive, naturally calibrated ensemble prediction of TC intensity derived from a training dataset of deterministic Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF; 2015 version) Model forecasts. In this implementation of the AnEn, a set of analog forecasts is generated by searching an HWRF archive for forecasts sharing key features with the current HWRF forecast. The forecast training period spans 2011-15. The similarity of a current forecast with past forecasts is estimated using predictors derived from the HWRF reforecasts that capture thermodynamic and kinematic properties of a TC's environment and its inner core. Additionally, the value of adding a multimodel intensity consensus forecast as an AnEn predictor is examined. Once analogs are identified, the verifying intensity observations corresponding to each analog HWRF forecast are used to produce the AnEn intensity prediction. In this work, the AnEn is developed for both the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins. The AnEn's performance with respect to mean absolute error (MAE) is compared with the raw HWRF output, the official National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast, and other top-performing NHC models. Also, probabilistic intensity forecasts are compared with a quantile mapping model based on the HWRF's intensity forecast. In terms of MAE, the AnEn outperforms HWRF in the eastern Pacific at all lead times examined and up to 24-h lead time in the Atlantic. Also, unlike traditional dynamical ensembles, the AnEn produces an excellent spread-skill relationship.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
