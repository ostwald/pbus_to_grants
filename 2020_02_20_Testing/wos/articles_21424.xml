The transition probabilities are in this case dependent on the magnetic hyperfine quantum number M-F of the upper state. We show that it is important to include perturbers with Delta(F) = +/- 1. The calculated transition rates are compared to experimental results, when available. The discrepancies between the resulting magnetic-fieldand hyperfine-induced transition rates and the experimental values in Be-like ions are discussed as well as the observability of the hyperfine-induced transitions in Ne-like ions.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
