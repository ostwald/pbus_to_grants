Comparisons with results from a 3-D chemical-transport model show that the (CO2)-C-14 distribution is now largely governed by the altitude/latitude dependence of the natural cosmogenic production rate, stratospheric transport, and propagation into the stratosphere of the decreasing radiocarbon trend in tropospheric CO2 due to fossil fuel combustion. From the observed correlation of (CO2)-C-14 with N2O mixing ratios, an annual global mean net flux of (CO2)-C-14 to the troposphere of 1.6(0.4)x10(17)molCO(2)yr(-1) and a global production rate of 2.2(0.6)x10(26) atoms(14)Cyr(-1) are empirically derived. The results also indicate that contemporary (CO2)-C-14 observations provide highly sensitive diagnostics for stratospheric transport and residence times in models.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
