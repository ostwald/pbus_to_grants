During the day, these vortices likely are dust devils, though no visual observations are available for confirmation. At night, hairpin vortices appear to have been observed. The structure and dynamics of several types of vortices are described and related to other vortex investigations, including tornadoes and hurricanes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
