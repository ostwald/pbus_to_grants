Assuming bias in TAS has stabilized in the 10year predictions, after bias adjustment, TAS anomalies for the 2016-2035 period in the 30year predictions initialized in 2006 are about 16% less than the uninitialized projections. One contributing factor for the improved climate simulation is the bias adjustment, which corrects the models' systematic errors and higher-than-observed decadal warming trend. Another important factor is the initialization with observations which constrains the ocean such that the starting points of the initialized simulations are close to the observed initial states.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>&lt;list list-type="bulleted" id="grl51459-list-0001"&gt; &lt;list-item id="grl51459-li-0001"&gt;Multi-model initialized hindcasts simulate past climate shifts &lt;list-item id="grl51459-li-0002"&gt;A 30 year initialized prediction shows less warming than uninitialized &lt;list-item id="grl51459-li-0003"&gt;Initialized predictions simulate less warming than uninitialized projections</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
