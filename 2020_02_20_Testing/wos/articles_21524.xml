The ensemble is generated by perturbing either the high-latitude electric potential or auroral energy flux in the assimilative mapping for ionosphere electrodynamics (AMIE). Simulations with perturbed high-latitude electric potential result in substantial intraensemble variability in the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to the geomagnetic storm, and the ensemble standard deviation for the change in NmF2 reaches 50-100% of the mean change. Such large intraensemble variability is not seen when perturbing the auroral energy flux. In this case, the effects of the forcing uncertainty are primarily confined to high latitudes. We therefore conclude that the specification of high-latitude electric fields is an important source of uncertainty when modeling the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to a geomagnetic storm. A multiple linear regression analysis of the results indicates that uncertainty in the storm time changes in the equatorial electric fields, neutral winds, and neutral composition can all contribute to the uncertainty in the ionosphere electron density. The results of the present study provide insight into the possible uncertainty in simulations of the low-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere response to geomagnetic storms due to imperfect knowledge of the high-latitude forcing.</p><p>Plain Language Summary Geomagnetic storms produce large changes in the Earth's ionosphere that can impact communications, navigation systems, and the electric power grid. The capability of numerical models to reproduce the ionospheric disturbance during a geomagnetic storm is partially dependent on accurately specifying the geomagnetic storm forcing at high latitudes. The forcing is, however, not known with complete accuracy due to imperfect observational knowledge and processes that occur at scales smaller than the model resolution. Numerical models typically neglect any forcing uncertainty, and it is unclear to what extent uncertainty in the forcing leads to uncertainty in the model response. In the present study, an ensemble of simulations in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model are performed to understand how uncertainty in the forcing parameters during a geomagnetic storm are propagated into uncertainty in the low-latitude to midlatitude ionosphere disturbance. The ensemble simulations demonstrate that there can be large uncertainty in numerical simulations of the low-latitude to midlatitude ionosphere response to a geomagnetic storm due to uncertainty in the forcing. Understanding the impact of forcing uncertainty may be useful for space weather forecasting models since it can provide an estimate of the reliability of the simulations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
