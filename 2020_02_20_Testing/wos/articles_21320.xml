This study's objective is to build real-time data-driven services that enable managers to rapidly estimate reservoir inflows from available data and models. We have tested the services using a case study of the Texas flooding events in the Lower Colorado River Basin in November 2014 and May 2015, which involved a sudden switch from drought to flooding. We have constructed two prediction models: a statistical model for flow prediction and a hybrid statistical and physics-based model that estimates errors in the flow predictions from a physics-based model. The study demonstrates that the statistical flow prediction model can be automated and provides acceptably accurate short-term forecasts. However, for longer term prediction (2h or more), the hybrid model fits the observations more closely than the purely statistical or physics-based prediction models alone. Both the flow and hybrid prediction models have been published as Web services through Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning (AzureML) service and are accessible through a browser-based Web application, enabling ease of use by both technical and nontechnical personnel.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
