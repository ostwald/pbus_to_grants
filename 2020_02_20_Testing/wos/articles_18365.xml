However, from the authors' experience radar data assimilation, when using the three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) technique, can produce spurious precipitation results and large errors in the position and amount of precipitation. One possible reason for the problem is attributed to the lack of proper balance in the dynamical and microphysical fields. This work attempts to minimize this problem by adding a large-scale analysis constraint in the cost function. The large-scale analysis constraint is defined by the departure of the high-resolution 3DVAR analysis from a coarser resolution large-scale analysis. It is found that this constraint is able to guide the assimilation process in such a way that the final result still maintains the large-scale pattern, while adding the convective characteristics where radar data are available. As a result, the 3DVAR analysis with the constraint is more accurate when verified against an independent dataset. The performance of this new constraint on improving precipitation forecasts is tested using six convective cases and verified against radar-derived precipitation by employing four skill indices. All of the skill indices show improved forecasts when using the methodology presented in this paper.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
