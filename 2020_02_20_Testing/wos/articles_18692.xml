Recent increases in VOC and NOx emissions associated with the production of oil and natural gas (O&amp;NG) may contribute to this trend in some areas. The Northern Front Range of Colorado has regularly exceeded O-3 air quality standards during summertime in recent years. This region has VOC emissions from a rapidly developing O&amp;NG basin and low concentrations of biogenic VOC in close proximity to urban-Denver NOx emissions. Here VOC OH reactivity (OHR), O-3 production efficiency (OPE), and an observationally constrained box model are used to quantify the influence of O&amp;NG emissions on regional summertime O-3 production. Analyses are based on measurements acquired over two summers at a central location within the Northern Front Range that lies between major regional O&amp;NG and urban emission sectors. Observational analyses suggest that mixing obscures any OPE differences in air primarily influenced by O&amp;NG or urban emission sector. The box model confirms relatively modest OPE differences that are within the uncertainties of the field observations. Box model results also indicate that maximum O-3 at the measurement location is sensitive to changes in NOx mixing ratio but also responsive to O&amp;NG VOC reductions. Combined, these analyses show that O&amp;NG alkanes contribute over 80% to the observed carbon mixing ratio, roughly 50% to the regional VOC OHR, and approximately 20% to regional photochemical O-3 production.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
