Toward this goal, such a framework has been developed by linking the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM4), and a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) within DART is utilized to estimate global multilayer soil moisture by assimilating brightness temperature observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). A 40-member ensemble of Community Atmosphere Model, version 4.0 (CAM4.0), reanalysis is adopted to drive CLM4 simulations. Space-specific, time-invariant microwave parameters are precalibrated to minimize uncertainties in RTM. Besides, various methods are designed to upscale AMSR-E observations for computational efficiency and time shift CAM4.0 forcing to facilitate global daily assimilations. A series of experiments are conducted to quantify the DA sensitivity to microwave parameters, choice of assimilated observations, and different CLM4 updating schemes. Evaluation results indicate that the newly established CLM4-RTM-DART framework improves the open-loop CLM4-simulated soil moisture. Precalibrated microwave parameters, rather than their default values, can ensure a more robust global-scale performance. In addition, updating near-surface soil moisture is capable of improving soil moisture in deeper layers (0-30 cm), while simultaneously updating multilayer soil moisture fails to obtain intended improvements. Future work is needed to address the systematic bias in CLM4 that cannot be fully covered through the ensemble spread in CAM4.0 reanalysis.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
