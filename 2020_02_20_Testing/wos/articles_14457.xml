When it is in-phase the anomalies of sea-level pressure adds to the average pressure distribution, and when it is out-of-phase it subtracts from it. Consequently, the atmospheric conditions over Europe in a sunspot peak depends on whether the North Atlantic Oscillation is in-or out-of-phase with the sunspot peak.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
