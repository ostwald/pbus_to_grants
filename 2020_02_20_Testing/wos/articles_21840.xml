The structural evolution of 180 western North Pacific TCs from 2002 to 2014 was measured by a new parameter, the RV ratio, which is defined as the ratio of a TC's radius of 34-kt (17.5 m s(-1)) wind to its maximum wind speed at the ending point of the intensification period. Whereas TCs with RV ratios in the lowest quartile of all 180 samples favored intensification over expansion, and 82% of these TCs experienced rapid intensification, TCs with RV ratios in the topmost quartile favored size expansion over intensification. A novel result of this study is that TC RV ratios were found to correlate with the LMF orientation relative to the deep-layer VWS vector. Specifically, whereas an LMF directed toward the left-of-shear orientation favors TC intensification, a right-of-shear LMF favors TC size expansion. This study further analyzed the TC rainfall asymmetry and asymmetric surface flow using satellite observations. Results show that for a TC affected by an LMF with right-of-shear orientation, the positive surface flux anomaly in the upshear outer region promotes convection in the downshear rainband region. On the other hand, a left-of-shear LMF induces a positive surface flux anomaly in the downshear outer region, thus promoting convection in the upshear inner core. Enhancement of the symmetric inner-core convection favors intensification, whereas enhancement of the downshear rainband favors expansion.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
