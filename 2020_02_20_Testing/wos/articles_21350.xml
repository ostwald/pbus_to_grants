Here, it is shown how quadratic polynomial regression can be performed within a serial data assimilation framework. The addition of quadratic polynomial regression to the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is also discussed and its performance is illustrated using a hierarchy of models from simple scalar systems to a GCM.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
