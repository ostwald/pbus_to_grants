In publications using such a technique, the background term of the transformed cost function is defined as a canonical inner product of the transformed control variable with itself. However, it is shown in this paper that this practical definition of the cost function is not correct if the CVT uses a square root of the background error covariance matrix B that is not square. Fortunately, it is then shown that there is a manifold of the control space for which this flaw has no impact, and that most minimizers used in practice precisely work in this manifold. It is also shown that both correct and practical transformed cost functions have the same minimum. This explains more rigorously why the CVT is working in practice. The case of a singular B is finally detailed, showing that the practical cost function still reaches the best linear unbiased estimate ( BLUE).</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
