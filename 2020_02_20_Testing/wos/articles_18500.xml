Fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes were quantified at the top of the forest canopy using a high-resolution proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). Snapshot (similar to aEuro-2aEuro-min sampling duration) vertical profiles of isoprene, methyl vinyl ketone (MVK)aEuro-+aEuro-methacrolein (MACR), and monoterpenes were collected from aircraft every hour in the CBL (100-1000aEuro-m). Both ground-based and airborne collected volatile organic compound (VOC) data are used to constrain the initial conditions of a mixed-layer chemistry model (MXLCH), which is applied to examine the chemical evolution of the O-3-NOx-HOx-VOC system and how it is affected by boundary layer dynamics in the CBL. The chemical loss rate of isoprene (similar to aEuro-1aEuro-h) is similar to the turbulent mixing timescale (0.1-0.5aEuro-h), which indicates that isoprene concentrations are equally dependent on both photooxidation and boundary layer dynamics. Analysis of a model-derived concentration budget suggests that diurnal evolution of isoprene inside the CBL is mainly controlled by surface emissions and chemical loss; the diurnal evolution of O-3 is dominated by entrainment. The NO to HO2 ratio (NOaEuro-:aEuro-HO2) is used as an indicator of anthropogenic impact on the CBL chemical composition and spans a wide range (1-163). The fate of hydroxyl-substituted isoprene peroxyl radical (HOC5H8OO center dot; ISOPOO) is strongly affected by NOaEuro-:aEuro-HO2, shifting from NO-dominant to NO-HO2-balanced conditions from early morning to noontime. This chemical regime change is reflected in the diurnal evolution of isoprene hydroxynitrates (ISOPN) and isoprene hydroxy hydroperoxides (ISOPOOH).</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
