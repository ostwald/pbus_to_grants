Quantifying the global average current and assessing its temporal variability is a challenge, however, because it requires measurements in every stormy region of the world. Thus, a retrieval algorithm has been developed to infer the electric fields and Wilson currents above electrified weather from NASA ER-2 passive microwave high-altitude aircraft observations that are also common satellite products.This study documents the adaptation of the passive microwave electric field and the Wilson current retrieval algorithm for use with satellite platforms. Three distinct variants on the algorithm are produced to respond to specific use cases that differ in 1) whether swath or microwave feature data are available to describe the lateral extent of electrified clouds, 2) the availability of coincident radar data to characterize the vertical structure of electrified clouds, and 3) the prioritization of scientific accuracy or computational expense and product latency. The Wilson currents produced by the satellite retrievals are compared with each other and also with coincident lightning measurements and the Carnegie curve. The advantages, caveats, and limitations of each variant are discussed.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
