In addition to directly increasing radiative forcing as a greenhouse gas, O-3 indirectly impacts climate through altering the plant processes of photosynthesis and transpiration. While global estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) have incorporated the effects of O-3, few studies have explicitly determined the independent effects of O-3 on transpiration. In this study, the authors include effects of O-3 on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance from a recent literature review to determine the impact on GPP and transpiration and highlight uncertainty in modeling plant responses to O-3. Using the Community Land Model, the authors estimate that present-day O-3 exposure reduces GPP and transpiration globally by 8%-12% and 2%-2.4%, respectively. The largest reductions were in midlatitudes, with GPP decreasing up to 20% in the eastern United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia and transpiration reductions of up to 15% in the same regions. Larger reductions in GPP compared to transpiration decreased water-use efficiency 5%-10% in the eastern United States, Southeast Asia, Europe, and central Africa; increased surface runoff more than 15% in eastern North America; and altered patterns of energy fluxes in the tropics, high latitudes, and eastern North America. Future climate predictions will be improved if plant responses to O-3 are incorporated into models such that stomatal conductance is modified independently of photosynthesis and the effects on transpiration are explicitly considered in surface energy budgets. Improvements will help inform regional decisions for managing changes in hydrology and surface temperatures in response to O-3 pollution.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
