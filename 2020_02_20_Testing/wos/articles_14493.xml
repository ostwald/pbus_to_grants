Data from three Chinese Ionosonde stations located in Mohe (52. 0 degrees N, 122. 5 degrees E), Zuoling (31. 0 degrees N, 114. 5 degrees E) and Fuke (19. 4 degrees N, 109. 0 degrees E) were used in the comparison. The results show that the correlation of the corresponding ionospheric parameters is pretty good and the NmF2 has a better correlation than h(m)F(2) has, and the correlation coefficient changes with the latitude and season. The correlations of both NmF2 and h(m)F(2) in middle geomagnetic latitudes are higher than those in equatorial ionization anomaly. The correlation coefficients in equatorial ionization anomaly in winter are lower than those in other seasons. The possible reason is that the electron density gradient during winter in the equatorial ionization anomaly is stronger than other seasons.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
