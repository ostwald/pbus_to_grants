In addition to the Global Positioning System (GPS), the FY3C/GNOS is capable of tracking the occultation signal of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) (also called COMPASS) from space for the first time. The quality of BDS radio occultation (RO) has been verified in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, the electron density profiles (EDPs) observed by FY3C/GNOS from both GPS RO and BDS RO, which were processed and archived in the National Satellite Meteorological Center of China Meteorological Administration, are compared with 32 globally distributed ionosonde observations, and then, we compare GPS RO EDPs with ionosonde observations at Mohe (52.0 degrees N, 122.5 degrees E), Beijing (40.3 degrees N, 116.2 degrees E), Wuhan (31.0 degrees N, 114.5 degrees E), and Sanya (18.3 degrees N, 109.6 degrees E). FY3C/GNOS EDPs show good agreement with ionosonde measurements, with larger discrepancies near the equatorial ionization anomaly region at Wuhan and Sanya. The ionospheric peak density (NmF2) and peak height (hmF2) derived from FY3C/GNOS EDPs are also compared with those obtained from the globally distributed ionosondes for the day of year 274-365 in 2013. In general, NmF2 and hmF2 have a higher correlation coefficient in the middle-high latitude than in the lower latitude region, due to the difference of ionospheric horizontal inhomogeneity. We also compared the NmF2 and hmF2 maps between FY3C/GNOS and the International Reference Ionosphere 2012 (IRI-2012) model. However, the wavenumber-4 structure, which can be indicated clearly from FY3C/GNOS observations, could not be reproduced well by IRI-2012. Further investigations show that the nighttime EDPs have obvious ionization enhancement around the ionospheric E layer over the Aurora and the South Atlantic Anomaly regions due to the energetic particle precipitation indicated by the Space Environment Monitor observations onboard FY3C.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
