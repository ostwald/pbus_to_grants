This article dealt with a simplified case in which the saturation specific humidity q(s)which is a slightly varying function of temperaturewas assumed to be constant. In trying to extend the results of Temam and Tribbia to the case where q(s) is not constant, it appeared that the equations of moist advection in this case were not coherent in the extreme cases where the atmosphere is totally dry or totally humid. The aim of this article is to describe this difficulty and propose a mathematically satisfying solution in the context of so-called variational inequalities.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
