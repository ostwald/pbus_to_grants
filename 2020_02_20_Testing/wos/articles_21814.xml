In numerically integrating the compressible equations, it is often beneficial to filter these acoustic modes to control acoustic noise and prevent its artificial growth. Here, a new technique is proposed for filtering the 3D divergence that may damp acoustic modes more effectively than filters previously implemented in numerical modes using horizontally explicit vertically implicit (HEVI) and split-explicit time integration schemes. With this approach, a divergence damping term is added as a final adjustment to the horizontal velocity at the new time level after completing the vertically implicit portion of the time step. In this manner, the divergence used in the filter term has exactly the same numerical form as that used in the discrete pressure equation. Analysis of the dispersion equation for this form of the filter documents its stability characteristics and confirms that it effectively damps acoustic modes with little artificial influence on the amplitude or propagation of the gravity wave modes that are of physical interest. Some specific aspects of the implementation of the filter in the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) are discussed, and results are presented to illustrate some of the beneficial aspects of suppressing acoustic noise.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
