These measurements reveal two distinct H+ ion populations, an similar to 40% decrease in topside plasma density, a similar drop in upward but not downward H+ ion flux, and a downward O+ ion velocity of similar to 100 m/s. These features are directly linked to changes in the H+/O+ composition and in interhemispheric or field-aligned light ion flow and to a reduction in the negative spacecraft potential. These observed features were absent on the preceding, noneclipse days and corroborate the reduction in F region plasma density and topside total electron content observed by the Global Positioning System receivers on board. They are attributed to the temporary reduction of photoionization in the eclipsed F region.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
