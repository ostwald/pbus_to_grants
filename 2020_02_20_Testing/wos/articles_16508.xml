The two high latitude wind instruments allow us, for the first time, to infer the zonal wavenumber of the semidiumal tide on a daily basis during an SSW event. The ground based FPIs recorded enhanced lower thermosphere semidiurnal tide before and during the SSW. The two high latitude stations did not show much westward propagating semidiurnal tide with zonal wavenumber one (SW1) as predicted by model simulations. Several indications of westward propagating zonal wavenumber three semidiurnal tide (SW3) require further verification. In addition, the TIMED TIDI lower thermospheric winds at 95 km also appear to show sign of SW3. High latitude terdiurnal and quaddiurnal oscillations were observed. Enhancements in the midlatitude thermospheric semidiurnal and terdiumal tides during the SSW were observed, which may be related to the gravity wave filtering by solar tides in the stratosphere and mesosphere. Unusually large thermospheric winds were observed before the SSW at Boulder, its connection to the planetary wave activity related to the SSW is still to be determined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
