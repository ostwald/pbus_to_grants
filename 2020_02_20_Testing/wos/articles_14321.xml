In this paper, we model the gravity waves (GWs) excited by deep convective plumes globally during 15-27 June in 2009 and in 2000 (previous solar maximum). We ray trace the GWs into the thermosphere and calculate the body force/heatings which result where they dissipate. We input these force/heatings into a global dynamical model and study the neutral and plasma changes that result. The body forces induce horizontal wind (u(H)') and temperature (T') perturbations, while the heatings primarily induce T'. We find that the forces create much larger T' than the heatings. u(H)' consists of clockwise and counterclockwise circulations and "jet"-like winds that are highly correlated with deep convection, with vertical bar u(H)'vertical bar similar to 50-200 m/s. u(H)' and T' are much larger during 2009 than 2000. u(H)' decreases slightly (significantly) with altitude from z similar to 150 to 400 km during 2009 (2000). T' perturbations at z = 350 km primarily propagate westward at similar to 460 m/s, consistent with migrating tides. It was found that planetary-scale diurnal and semidiurnal tides are generated in situ in the thermosphere, with amplitudes similar to 10-40 m/s at z = 250 km. The largest-amplitude in situ tides are DW1, D0, DW2, SW2, SW3, and SW5. Smaller-amplitude in situ tides are S0, SE2, and SW3. Total electron content (TEC') perturbations of 1-2.5 (2-3.5) total electron content units (TECU, where 1 TECU = 10(16) el m(-2)) during 2009 (2000) are created in the upper atmosphere above nearby regions of deep tropical convection. For a given local time (LT), there are 2 to 3 TEC' peaks in longitude around the Earth.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
