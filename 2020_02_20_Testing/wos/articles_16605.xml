With the introduction of a new semi-implicit CISL discretization of the continuity equation, the nonhydrostatic solver, called CSLAM-NH, has been shown to ensure inherently conservative and numerically consistent transport of air mass and other scalar variables, such as moisture and passive tracers. The extended CSLAM-NH presented here includes two main modifications: transformation of the equation set to a terrain-following height coordinate to incorporate orography and an iterative centered-implicit time-stepping scheme to enhance the stability of the scheme associated with gravity wave propagation at large time steps. CSLAM-NH is tested for a suite of idealized 2D flows, including linear mountain waves (dry), a downslope windstorm (dry), and orographic cloud formation.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
