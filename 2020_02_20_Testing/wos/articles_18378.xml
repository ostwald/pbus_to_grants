We propose a general suite of optical measurements that can be used to determine the basic visual performance characteristics for a variety of immersive display systems. These methods utilize current display industry best practices and new research that anticipates the measurement challenges posed by the new technologies. We discuss the need for higher resolution detectors for the new generation of laser and LED (light-emitting diode) projector systems. The introduction of multi-primary displays is addressed by the implementation of new test patterns that better simulate the display performance of typical images. Methods to evaluate the unique attributes of stereoscopic displays, such as cross-talk and left eye/right eye differences, are described and interpreted. In addition, it is shown that the ambient lighting environment or display topology can have a detrimental impact on the display image quality. The application of these measurement methodologies is demonstrated by the evaluation of three display systems: two rear-projection and one front-projection display. We highlight how these measurements can identify potential display performance limitations, and offer advice on how to address some of these limitations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
