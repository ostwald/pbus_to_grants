For wind power, the study is conducted over a 2-year long period, with hourly data of the aggregated wind power output of the Sicily island. The 0-72 h wind predictions are generated with the limited-area Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), with boundary conditions provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) deterministic forecast. For solar irradiance, we consider daily data of the aggregated solar radiation energy output (based on the Kaggle competition dataset) over an 8-year long period. Numerical Weather Prediction data for the contest come from the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration- Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) Reforecast Version 2. The PCA is applied to reduce the datasets dimension. A Neural Network (NN) and an Analog Ensemble (AnEn) post-processing are then applied on the PCA output to obtain the final forecasts. The study shows that combining PCA with these post-processing techniques leads to better results when compared to the implementation without the PCA reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
