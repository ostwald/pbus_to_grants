Climate changes over East Asia between the two warming periods and the associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. Analyses of observation and reanalysis data show that winter precipitation has decreased (increased) over southern (northeastern) China from 1985-98 to 1999-2013. Winds at 300 hPa over East Asia strengthened during 1999-2013 around 308-47.58N but weakened to the north and south of it. This change pattern caused the East Asian polar front jet (EAPJ) and the East Asian subtropical jet (EASJ) to shift, respectively, equatorward and poleward during 1999-2013. Associated with these jet displacements, the Siberian high enhanced and the East Asian trough shifted westward. The enhanced Siberian high strengthened the East Asian winter monsoon and weakened southwesterly winds over the South China Sea, leading to precipitation decreases over southern China. The westward shift of the East Asian trough enhanced convergence and precipitation over northeastern China. A combination of a negative phase of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation and a positive phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation during 1999-2013 resulted in significant tropospheric warming over the low and high latitudes and cooling over the midlatitudes of East Asia. These changes enhanced the meridional temperature gradient and thus westerlies over the region between the two jets but weakened them to the south and north of it, thereby contributing to the wind change patterns and the jet displacements.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
