The onset of internal gravity wave breaking and leeside flow response regimes of trapped lee waves and nonlinear breakdown (or hydraulic-jump-like state) as they depend on the classical inverse Froude number, Fr-1 = Nh/U-g, is explored in detail. Here, N is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, h is the hill height, and U-g is the geostrophic wind. The results here demonstrate that the presence of a turbulent ABL influences mountain wave (MW) development in critical aspects, such as dissipation of trapped lee waves and amplified stagnation zone turbulence through Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. It is shown that the nature of interactions between the largescale flow and the ABL is better characterized by a proposed inverse compensated Froude number, Fr-c(-1) = N(h - zi)/U-g, where zi is the ABL height. In addition, it is found that the onset of the nonlinear-breakdown regime, Fr-c(-1) approximate to 1.0, is initiated when the vertical wavelength becomes comparable to the sufficiently energetic scales of turbulence in the stagnation zone and ABL, yielding an abrupt change in leeside flow response. Finally, energy spectra are presented in the context of MW flows, supporting the existence of a clear transition in leeside flow response, and illustrating two distinct energy distribution states for the trapped-lee-wave and the nonlinear-breakdown regimes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
