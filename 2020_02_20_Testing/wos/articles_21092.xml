This study deployed a network of seven low-cost ozone metal oxide sensor systems (UPods) in both an open space and an urban location in Boulder, Colorado during June and July of 2015, to quantify ozone variations on spatial scales ranging from 12 m between UPods to 6.7 km between open space and urban measurement sites with a measurement uncertainty of similar to 5 ppb. The results showed spatial variability of ozone at both deployment sites, with the largest differences between UPod measurements occurring during the afternoons. The peak median hourly difference between UPods was 6 ppb at 1:00 p.m. at the open space site, and 11 ppb at 4:00 p.m. at the urban site. Overall, the urban ozone measurements were higher than in the open space measurements. This study evaluates the effectiveness of using low-cost sensors to capture microscale spatial and temporal variation of ozone; additionally, it highlights the importance of field calibrations and measurement uncertainty quantification when deploying low-cost sensors.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
