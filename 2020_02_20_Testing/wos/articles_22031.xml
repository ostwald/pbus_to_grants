Previous works show that foreshock transients can induce both Alfven mode and compressional mode Pc 3-5 ULF waves inside the magnetosphere. However, to our knowledge, none of these reported Pc 3-5 waves, induced by foreshock transients, are proved to be localized in the magnetosphere. In this paper, using in situ and ground-based observations, we report the generation of localized magnetospheric compressional waves and field line resonances (FLRs) by a foreshock transient. Both the foreshock transient and Pc 5 ULF waves were found on the duskside; while on the morning side of the magnetosphere, no clear wave signatures were captured. Our results demonstrate that in addition to the global effects of foreshock transients on the magnetosphere reported earlier, foreshock transients can also generate localized magnetospheric responses in the Pc 5 range with clear dawn-dusk asymmetry. A suite of eight dayside spacecraft plus ground magnetometer measurements make possible the determination of the foreshock transient driver and dawn-dusk asymmetry of the magnetospheric response not previously reported with such a complete data set.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
