However, there are very limited data sets with both microscale resolution and global coverage to provide a hemispheric comparison of cirrus cloud microphysical properties and their evolution. Here we use in situ aircraft observations on the similar to 200mscale from 87 degrees N to 67 degrees S over North America and the central Pacific Ocean to analyze the hemispheric differences in the evolution of cirrus clouds' horizontal segments-ice supersaturated regions (ISSRs) and ice crystal regions (ICRs). In contrast to previous in situ observations, we show that the clear-sky ice supersaturation frequency, resulting microphysical parameters (ice crystal size and concentration), and relative timescale of the life cycle of ISSRs and ICRs are similar between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. More studies on hemispheric ice nuclei distributions and dynamical conditions are needed to help explain these observations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
