These are specifically near-term climate forcers (NTCFs: methane, tropospheric ozone and aerosols, and their precursors), nitrous oxide and ozone-depleting halocarbons. The aim of AerChemMIP is to answer four scientific questions.</p><p>How have anthropogenic emissions contributed to global radiative forcing and affected regional climate over the historical period?</p><p>How might future policies (on climate, air quality and land use) affect the abundances of NTCFs and their climate impacts?</p><p>How do uncertainties in historical NTCF emissions affect radiative forcing estimates?</p><p>How important are climate feedbacks to natural NTCF emissions, atmospheric composition, and radiative effects?</p><p>These questions will be addressed through targeted simulations with CMIP6 climate models that include an interactive representation of tropospheric aerosols and atmospheric chemistry. These simulations build on the CMIP6 Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments, the CMIP6 historical simulations, and future projections performed elsewhere in CMIP6, allowing the contributions from aerosols and/or chemistry to be quantified. Specific diagnostics are requested as part of the CMIP6 data request to highlight the chemical composition of the atmosphere, to evaluate the performance of the models, and to understand differences in behaviour between them.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
