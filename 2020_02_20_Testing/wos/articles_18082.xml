Measurements made at low altitudes (&lt;5km mean sea level (MSL)) in the storm inflow region were compared to those made in cirrus anvils (altitude&gt;9km MSL). Storm mean outflow Ca2+ mass concentrations and total coarse (1 mu m&lt;diameter&lt;5 mu m) aerosol volume (V-c) were comparable to mean inflow values as demonstrated by average outflow/inflow ratios greater than 0.5. A positive relationship between Ca2+, V-c, ice water content, and large (diameter&gt;50 mu m) ice particle number concentrations was not evident; thus, the influence of ice shatter on these measurements was assumed small. Mean inflow aerosol number concentrations calculated over a diameter range (0.5 mu m&lt;diameter&lt;5.0 mu m) relevant for proxy ice nuclei (N-PIN) were similar to 15-300 times higher than ice particle concentrations for all storms. Ratios of predicted interstitial N-PIN (calculated as the difference between inflow N-PIN and ice particle concentrations) and inflow N-PIN were consistent with those calculated for Ca2+ and V-c and indicated that on average less than 10% of the ingested N-PIN were activated as ice nuclei during anvil formation. Deep convection may therefore represent an efficient transport mechanism for dust to the upper troposphere where these particles can function as ice nuclei cirrus forming in situ.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
