Warm-core meso--scale vortex formation occurs in a deeply moist, potentially stable environment that is conducive to the development of near-surface rotation and is somewhat atypical compared to known derecho-supporting environments.Air parcels in the vicinity of the developing vortex primarily originate near the surface in the streamwise vorticity-rich environment, associated with the vertical wind shear of the low-level jet, immediately to the east of the eastward-moving system. Cyclonic vertical vorticity is generated along inflowing air parcels primarily by the ascent-induced tilting of streamwise vorticity and amplified primarily by ascent-induced vortex tube stretching. Descent-induced tilting of crosswise vorticity contributes to cyclonic vertical vorticity generation for the small population of air parcels in the vicinity of the developing vortex that originate to its north and west. No consistent source of preexisting vertical vorticity is present within the environment.Cyclonic circulation on the scale of the warm-core meso--scale vortex increases in the lower troposphere in response to the mean vortex-scale convergence of cyclonic absolute vorticity and the local expulsion of eddy anticyclonic vertical vorticity generated within the system's cold pool. Increased cyclonic circulation is partially offset by the system-scale tilting of horizontal vorticity associated with the low-level jet, rear-inflow jet, environmental vertical wind shear, and rotational flow of the warm-core vortex itself.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
