The method uses principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze spatiotemporal balancing of wind energy resources and then assesses the optimal wind farm location to reduce wind power fluctuations. The ability of different reference wind turbines, alone or interconnected, to provide stable power is ultimately evaluated at selected locations. The method was tested in the southern Iberian Peninsula, including offshore areas. We used hourly wind energy estimates from the WRF mesoscale model at 3-km spatial resolution for the period 2008-2010. First, results show a valuable spatial balancing pattern between the wind energy resources in the northeast study region and Strait of Gibraltar area. The pattern was found to result from the interaction of mesoscale zonal flow with the complex topography of the region. Second, the results indicate that by taking advantage of the spatial balancing pattern, the optimal allocation and interconnection of wind farms across the region, can substantially reduce wind power fluctuations. This optimal allocation can in some cases generate stable power, thereby contributing to baseload power. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
