Low-level wind fields play an important role in dispersion of air pollutants, including radionuclides, in a high-resolution WRF framework. By implementing two subgrid-scale orography parameterizations (Jimenez and Dudhia in J Appl Meteorol Climatol 51:300-316, 2012; Mass and Ovens in WRF model physics: problems, solutions and a new paradigm for progress. Preprints, 2010 WRF Users' Workshop, NCAR, Boulder, Colo. http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/workshops/WS2010/presentations/session%204/4-1_WRFworkshop2010Final.pdf, 2010), we tried to compare the performance of parameterizations and to enhance the forecast skill of low-level wind fields over the central western part of South Korea. Even though both subgrid-scale orography parameterizations significantly alleviated the positive bias at 10-m wind speed, the parameterization by Jimenez and Dudhia revealed a better forecast skill in wind speed under our modeling configuration. Implementation of the subgrid-scale orography parameterizations in the model did not affect the forecast skills in other meteorological fields including 10-m wind direction. Our study also brought up the problem of discrepancy in the definition of 10-m wind between model physics parameterizations and observations, which can cause overestimated winds in model simulations. The overestimation was larger in stable conditions than in unstable conditions, indicating that the weak diurnal cycle in the model could be attributed to the representation error.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
