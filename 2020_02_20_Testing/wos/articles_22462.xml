The U.S. Navy operational numerical weather prediction model known as the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) performed well forecasting large-scale conditions during the experiment, with an observed warm bias in SST and cold and dry biases in temperature and humidity in the lowest 2000 m. In general, COAMPS underpredicted the number of ducts, and they were weaker and at lower height than those seen in observations. It was found that there is a noticeable diurnal evolution of the ducts, more over land than over the ocean. Ducts were found to be more frequent over land but overall were stronger and deeper over the ocean. Also, the evaporative duct height increases as one moves offshore. A case study was chosen to describe the electromagnetic properties under different synoptic conditions. In this case the continental atmospheric boundary layer dominates and interacts with the marine atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, the latter moves around 80 km offshore and then back inland after 2 h.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
