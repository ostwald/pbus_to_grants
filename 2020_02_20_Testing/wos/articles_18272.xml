Tropopause upwelling is derived based on the wave forcing computed from ERA-Interim using the momentum and mass conservation equations in the transformed Eulerian-mean framework. The calculated upwelling agrees well with other upwelling estimates and successfully captures the annual cycle, with a maximum during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter. The spectrum of wave forcing reveals that the zonal wavenumber-3 component drives a large portion of the annual cycle in upwelling. The wave activity flux (Eliassen-Palm flux) shows that the associated waves originate from the NH extratropics and the Southern Hemisphere tropics during December-February, with both regions contributing significant wavenumber-3 fluxes. These wave fluxes are nearly absent during June-August. Wavenumbers 1 and 2 and synoptic-scale waves have a notable contribution to tropopause upwelling but have little influence on the annual cycle, except the wavenumber-4 component. The quasigeostrophic refractive index suggests that the NH extratropical wavenumber-3 component can enhance tropopause upwelling because these planetary-scale waves are largely trapped in the vertical, while being refracted toward the subtropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Regression analysis based on interannual variability suggests that the wavenumber-3 waves are related to tropical convection and wave breaking along the subtropical jet in the NH extratropics.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
