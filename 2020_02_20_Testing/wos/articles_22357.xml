It is a common target species of ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) near-infrared (TCCON) and mid-infrared (NDACC) measurements. Both TCCON and NDACC networks provide a long-term global distribution of atmospheric N2O mole fraction. In this study, the dry-air column-averaged mole fractions of N2O (X-N2O) from the TCCON and NDACC measurements are compared against each other at seven sites around the world (Ny-Alesund, Sodankyla, Bremen, Izana, Reunion, Wollongong, Lauder) in the time period of 2007-2017. The mean differences in X-N2O between TCCON and NDACC (NDACC-TCCON) at these sites are between -3.32 and 1.37 ppb (-1.1 %-0.5 %) with standard deviations between 1.69 and 5.01 ppb (0.5 %-1.6 %), which are within the uncertainties of the two datasets. The NDACC N2O retrieval has good sensitivity throughout the troposphere and stratosphere, while the TCCON retrieval underestimates a deviation from the a priori in the troposphere and overestimates it in the stratosphere. As a result, the TCCON X-N2O measurement is strongly affected by its a priori profile.</p><p>Trends and seasonal cycles of X-N2O are derived from the TCCON and NDACC measurements and the nearby surface flask sample measurements and compared with the results from GEOS-Chem model a priori and a posteriori simulations. The trends and seasonal cycles from FTIR measurement at Ny-Alesund and Sodankyla are strongly affected by the polar winter and the polar vortex. The a posteriori N2O fluxes in the model are optimized based on surface N2O measurements with a 4D-Var inversion method. The X-N2O trends from the GEOS-Chem a posteriori simulation (0.97 +/- 0.02 (1 sigma) ppb yr(-1)) are close to those from the NDACC (0.93 +/- 0.04 ppb yr(-1)) and the surface flask sample measurements (0.93 +/- 0.02 ppb yr(-1)). The X-N2O trend from the TCCON measurements is slightly lower (0.81 +/- 0.04 ppb yr(-1)) due to the underestimation of the trend in TCCON a priori simulation. The X-N2O trends from the GEOS-Chem a priori simulation are about 1.25 ppb yr(-1), and our study confirms that the N2O fluxes from the a priori inventories are overestimated. The seasonal cycles of X-N2O from the FTIR measurements and the model simulations are close to each other in the Northern Hemisphere with a maximum in August-October and a minimum in February-April. However, in the Southern Hemisphere, the modeled X-N2O values show a minimum in February-April while the FTIR X-N2O retrievals show different patterns. By comparing the partial column-averaged N2O from the model and NDACC for three vertical ranges (surface-8, 8-17, 17-50 km), we find that the discrepancy in the X-N2O seasonal cycle between the model simulations and the FTIR measurements in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly due to their stratospheric differences.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
