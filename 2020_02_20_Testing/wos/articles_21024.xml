Spectropolarimetry offers the best, and sometimes only, method of obtaining accurate measurements of the Sun's magnetic field. New 1.5-2 m class telescopes with adaptive optics have come on line, and the Daniel K. Inouye 4 m Solar Telescope (DKIST) will begin observing in 2019. The calibration of polarized light entering such a large and polarizing ground-based telescope represents difficult challenges. This paper explores how special polarization properties of particular atomic transitions may provide calibration data, augmenting or even avoiding time-consuming calibration observations, as well as science data. This initial study concludes that solar spectral lines exist with special polarization properties, allowing the telescope calibration to be determined. The Sun's visible and infrared spectrum is dominated by lines of neutral atoms and singly charged ions of iron and other complex atoms. Both solar and atomic physics should jointly benefit from telescopic advances, as observers explore regimes of broader wavelength ranges, and higher spatial resolutions and polarimetric sensitivities, than they have reached in the past. Further work is in progress to identify particular transitions of practical use to aid in calibrations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
