In this part, axisymmetric simulations with constant viscosity are used to explore the relationships between vortex structure, intensity, and unsteadiness as functions of diffusion (measured by a Reynolds number Re-r) and rotation (measured by a swirl ratio S-r). A deep upper-level damping zone is used to prevent upper-level disturbances from affecting the low-level vortex. The damping zone is most effective when it overlaps with the specified convective forcing, causing a reduction to the effective convective velocity scale W-e. With this damping in place, the tornado-vortex boundary layer shows no sign of unsteadiness for a wide range of parameters, suggesting that turbulence in the tornado boundary layer is inherently a three-dimensional phenomenon. For high Re-r, the most intense vortices have maximum mean tangential winds well in excess of W-e, and maximum mean vertical velocity exceeds 3 times W-e. In parameter space, the most intense vortices fall along a line that follows S-r similar to Re-r(-1/3), in agreement with previous analytical predictions by Fiedler and Rotunno. These results are used to inform the design of three-dimensional large-eddy simulations in subsequent papers.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
