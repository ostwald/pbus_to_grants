This work extends previous studies by simulating deposition to the HKHK region not only under current conditions but also in the 2040-2050 period under two realistic emission scenarios and in three different phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Under current conditions, sources from outside our South Asian modeling domain have a similar impact on total BC deposition to the HKHK region (35-87%, varying with month) as South Asian anthropogenic sources (13-62%). Industry (primarily brick kilns) and residential solid fuel burning combined account for 45-66% of the in-domain anthropogenic BC deposition to the HKHK region. Under a no further control emission scenario for 2040-2050, the relative contributions to BC deposition in the HKHK region are more skewed toward in-domain anthropogenic sources (45-65%) relative to sources outside the domain (26-52%). The in-domain anthropogenic BC deposition has significant contributions from industry (32-42%), solid fuel burning (17-28%), and diesel fuel burning (17-27%). Under a scenario in which emissions in South Asia are mitigated, the relative contribution from South Asian anthropogenic sources is significantly reduced to 11-34%. The changes due to phase of ENSO do not seem to follow consistent patterns with ENSO. Future work will use the high-resolution deposition maps developed here to determine the impact of different sources of BC on glacier melt and water availability in the region.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
