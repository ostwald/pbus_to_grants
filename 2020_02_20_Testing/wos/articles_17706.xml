Offshore of India, diurnal propagation of precipitation is observed over the Bay of Bengal. On the eastern side of the bay, a diurnal but nonpropagating signal is observed near the west coast of Burma. This asymmetry is consistent with the inertio-gravity wave mechanism. Perturbations generated by diurnal heating over the coastal mountains of India propagate offshore, amplify in the upwind direction, and dissipate in the downwind direction relative to the steering wind, owing to critical-level considerations. A linear model is applied to evaluate sensitivity to gravity waves, as these affect deep moist convection and propagation. Analyses are performed for various heating depths, mountain widths, stability, Coriolis effect, background mean wind, and friction. Calculations reveal how these factors affect the amplitude, dissipation, initiation phase, and propagation speed of the diurnal disturbance. The propagation of precipitation triggered by land-sea breezes is distinguishable from that triggered by a mountain-plains circulation. Convection resulting purely from mountain heating begins earlier, propagates slower, and damps faster than that of the land-sea breeze. For mountains near a coast, slower propagation and stronger earlier convection result from a resonance-like combination of two dynamical mechanisms. The propagation of precipitation is initially triggered by the mountain breeze near the coastal mountain. Over the open ocean, the dominant signal propagates as that of the land breeze but with stronger convection.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
