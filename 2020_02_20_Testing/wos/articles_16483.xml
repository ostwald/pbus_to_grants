This limitation can be tackled by using the probabilistic predictions that provide accurate deterministic forecasts along with a quantification of their uncertainty. We propose as a novelty the application of an analog ensemble (AnEn) method to generate probabilistic wind power forecasts (WPF). The AnEn prediction of a given variable is constituted by a set of measurements of the past, concurrent to the past forecasts most similar to the current one. The AnEn performance for WPF is compared with three state-of-the-science methods for probabilistic predictions over a wind farm and a 505-day long period: a wind power prediction based on the ensemble wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System (ECMWF-EPS), the Limited-area Ensemble Prediction System (LEPS) developed within the COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling (COSMO-LEPS) and a quantile regression (QR) technique. The AnEn performs as well as ECMWF-EPS, COSMO-LEPS and QR for common events while it exhibits more skill for rare events. A comparison with the performances obtained with a deterministic forecasting method based on a Neural Network is also carried out showing the benefits of using AnEn. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
