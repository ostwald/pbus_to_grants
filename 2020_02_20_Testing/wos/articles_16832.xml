Without moist and realistic radiative processes, the dry model successfully reproduces the zonal-mean structure of the CPT. The modeled CPT is appreciably colder (similar to 10 K) than the prescribed equilibrium temperature, and it is maintained by upwelling in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). A transient simulation starting from an axisymmetric steady state without the CPT shows that the evolution and maintenance of the CPT are closely related to the zonal-mean-flow response to wave driving in the stratosphere. The transformed Eulerian-mean analysis indicates that the wave driving is mostly due to convergence of synoptic-scale waves originating from the midlatitude troposphere and propagating into the subtropical UTLS in this model simulation. The modeled CPT also shows a large sensitivity to increased baroclinicity in the equilibrium temperature. Although planetary-scale waves are not considered in this simulation, the result confirms that wave-driven upwelling in the tropical UTLS is a crucial process for the formation and maintenance of the CPT. In addition, it also implies that synoptic-scale waves may play a nonnegligible role in this mechanism, particularly in the seasons when planetary-scale wave activity in the lower stratosphere is weak.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
