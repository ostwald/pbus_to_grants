Improved instrument calibration, redundant sensors, longer flight legs, energy flux estimation, and scale analysis revealed several new gravity wave properties. Over the sea, flight-level wave fluxes mostly fell below the detection threshold. Over terrain, disturbances had characteristic mountain wave attributes of positive vertical energy flux (EFz), negative zonal momentum flux, and upwind horizontal energy flux. In some cases, the fluxes changed rapidly within an 8-h flight, even though environmental conditions were nearly unchanged. The largest observed zonal momentum and vertical energy fluxes were MFx = -550 mPa and EFz = 22W m(-2), respectively.</p><p>A wide variety of disturbance scales were found at flight level over New Zealand. The vertical wind variance at flight level was dominated by short "fluxless'' waves with wavelengths in the 6-15-km range. Even shorter scales, down to 500 m, were found in wave breaking regions. The wavelength of the flux-carrying mountain waves was much longer-mostly between 60 and 150 km. In the strong cases, however, with EFz &gt; 4W m(-2), the dominant flux wavelength decreased (i.e., "downshifted'') to an intermediate wavelength between 20 and 60 km. Apotential explanation for the rapid flux changes and the scale "downshifting'' is that low-level flow can shift between "terrain following'' and "envelope following'' associated with trapped air in steep New Zealand valleys.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
