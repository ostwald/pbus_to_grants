One of the challenges with processing LEO magnetic field measurements to study Earth's magnetic field is that the satellite flies in regions of highly varying ionospheric currents. The ionospheric signals need to be removed from the measurements to isolate the signal from the Earth's magnetic field. Therefore, it is crucial to describe the ionospheric current accurately. The present study focuses on the ionospheric current systems due to gravity and plasma pressure gradient forcing and aims to provide guidance on the estimation of their magnetic effect at LEO altitudes. We assess the diamagnetic approximation which estimates the magnetic signal of the plasma pressure gradient current. And we introduce and evaluate a method to capture the magnetic effect of the gravity-driven current. Both approximations simplify the current system which leads to an error. The combined gravity and plasma pressure gradient magnetic effect tends to cancel above approximately 500 km; however, between approximately 300 and 500 km it exhibits a significant height and latitudinal variation. The combined magnetic signal is less than 1 nT above 300 km during solar minimum and up to 9 nT during solar maximum.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
