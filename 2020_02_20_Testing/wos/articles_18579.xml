It quantifies, present-day premature mortalities associated with the exposure to near-surface PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations in India using a regional chemistry model. We estimate that PM2.5 exposure leads to about 570,000 (CI95: 320,000-730,000) premature mortalities in 2011. On a national scale, our estimate of mortality by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to O-3 exposure is about 12,000 people. The Indo-Gangetic region accounts for a large part (similar to 42%) of the estimated mortalities. The associated lost life expectancy is calculated as 3.4 +/- 1.1 years for all of India with highest values found for Delhi (6.3 +/- 2.2 years). The economic cost of estimated premature mortalities associated with PM2.5 and O-3 exposure is about 640 (350-800) billion USD in 2011, which is a factor of 10 higher than total expenditure on health by public and private expenditure.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
