We demonstrate that the difference is due to the connectivity of active regions to the toroidal field at the base of the convection zone, which is not accounted for in the surface-only model. Initially, we consider the decay of a single active region, firstly in a simplified Cartesian 2D model and subsequently the full 3D model. By varying the turbulent diffusivity profile in the convection zone, we find that increasing the diffusivity - so that active regions are more rapidly disconnected from the base of the convection zone - improves the evolution of the surface field. However, if we simulate a full solar cycle, we find that the dynamo is unable to sustain itself under such an enhanced diffusivity. This suggests that in order to accurately model the solar cycle, we must find an alternative way to disconnect emerging active regions, whilst conserving magnetic flux.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
