The ratio between the grid resolutions in the high and low resolution regions (hereafter RHL) is set to 1: 2, 1: 3 and 1: 4 for 10242 cells and 40962 cells, and the width of the grid transition zone (for simplicity, WTZ) is set to 18 degrees and 9 degrees to investigate their impacts on the model simulation. The ideal test cases, i.e. the cosine bell and global steady-state nonlinear zonal geostrophic flow, are carried out with the above settings. Simulation results show that the larger the RHL is, the larger the resulting error is. It is obvious that the 1: 4 ratio gives rise to much larger errors than the 1: 2 or 1: 3 ratio; the errors resulting from the WTZ is much smaller than that from the RHL. No significant wave distortion or reflected waves are found when the fluctuation passes through the refinement region, and the error is significantly small in the refinement region. Therefore, when designing a local refinement scheme in the global model with SCVT, the RHL should be less than 1: 4, i.e., the error is acceptable when the RHL is 1: 2 or 1: 3.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
