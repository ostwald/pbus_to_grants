The driving mechanism for the generation of the ETA trough in the model is field-aligned ion drag. In our simulations, during the daytime, field-aligned ion drag on the north-south flanks of the magnetic equator causes a divergence in meridional winds, leading to an upward change in vertical winds, adiabatic cooling, and a reduction in neutral temperature of about 30 K over the magnetic equator near 400 km. This response closely links ETA behavior to variations in the equatorial ionosphere anomaly (EIA) associated with local time and solar cycle. As the EIA begins to disappear in the evening, the processes in the ETA mechanism recede, causing the ETA trough to subside. The ETA trough is not completely eliminated until about after 23: 00 LT. In our simulations, the trough becomes more prominent as the solar cycle progresses from low (F-10.7 = 80) to high (F-10.7 = 180), in agreement with observations. The neutral-ion collision frequency (proportional to variations in electron density) controls ETA day-to-night and solar cycle variations, while plasma scale height and gradients in electron number density and plasma temperature produce a secondary structure in ETA local time behavior that varies with solar cycle levels.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
