These differences can cause large errors in radar estimates of maximum tangential wind speeds, and large errors in single-Doppler retrievals of radial and vertical velocities. Since larger scatterers (e.g., debris) exhibit larger differences from air velocities compared to small scatterers (e.g., raindrops), the dominant scatterer type affecting radar measurements is examined. In this study, radar variables are simulated for common weather radar frequencies using debris and raindrop trajectories computed with a large-eddy simulation model and two electromagnetic scattering models. These simulations include a large range of raindrop and wood board sizes and concentrations, and reveal the significant frequency dependence of the equivalent reflectivity factor and Doppler velocity. At S band, dominant scatterers are wood boards, except when wood board concentrations are very low. In contrast, raindrops are the dominant scatterers at Ka and W bands even when large concentrations of wood boards are present, except for low raindrop concentrations. Dual-wavelength velocity differences exhibit high correlation with air and Doppler velocity differences for most cases, which may enable direct measurements of scatterer-induced Doppler velocity bias in tornadoes. Moreover, dual-wavelength ratios are shown to exhibit strong correlations with dominant scatterer size, except when Rayleigh scatterers are dominant. Finally, vertical velocity retrievals are shown to exhibit lower errors at high frequencies, and large errors remain at centimeter wavelengths even after debris centrifuging corrections are applied in cases with high debris concentration.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
