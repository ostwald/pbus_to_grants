This report is also the first observation of short-period (1-5 days) eastward propagating PWs from 30 km all the way to 110 km. The Specified Dynamics-Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model reproduces the observed three dominant peaks of amplitudes in temperature and coherent vertical phase structures. The data-model comparison indicates a possible mechanism: After PWs originated from the stratosphere dissipate along the critical level, the surviving waves are amplified by in situ instability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, resulting in the second (third) peak in geopotential (temperature). This third peak in temperature explains the PW amplitude growth from 100 to 110 km.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
