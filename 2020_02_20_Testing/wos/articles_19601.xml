The TIEGCM simulation overestimates the thermospheric wind by 30 to 60%. The thermospheric winds at Eureka were larger than those at Resolute probably because Eureka is at high-geomagnetic latitude. The observed ion drifts observed by Resolute Incoherent Scatter Radar North face at Resolute also show that the Weimer ion convection model overestimates the ion drift. The observation and simulation also appear to suggest that the ion convection pattern in the Weimer model may be too large. The observed thermospheric winds at Jang Bogo are smaller than the TIEGCM but mostly in the zonal component. The thermospheric winds are smaller at Jang Bogo than the two northern stations which are likely due to their lower magnetic latitude. The results indicate the presence of internal structure in the thermospheric winds inside the polar cap and call for more observations in the polar cap to be undertaken.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
