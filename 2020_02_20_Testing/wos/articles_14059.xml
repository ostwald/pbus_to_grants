The simulated cloudy boundary layer is based on the already well-documented and previously simulated 21 June 1997 case at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains central facility. The surface energy balance response to cloud shading is highly nonlinear, leading to different partitioning between sensible and latent heat flux compared to the surface not impacted by cloud. The evaporative fraction increases by about 2%-3% in the presence of shallow cumuli at the regional scale but can increase by up to 30% at any individual location. As expected, the cloud's reduction of solar irradiance largely controls the surface's response. However, the turbulence and secondary circulations associated with the cloud dynamics increases the surface flux variability. Even though they are less than 1 km in horizontal scale, the cloud-induced surface heterogeneities impact the vertical flux of heat and moisture up to approximately 20% of the height of the subcloud layer z(sl), higher than the surface layer's typical extent. Above 0.2z(sl), the cloud root tends to amplify the drying and the cooling of the subcloud layer. Near the entrainment zone, the cloud-induced latent heat flux increase and sensible heat flux decrease compensate each other with respect to total buoyancy and therefore do not significantly modify the subcloud-layer entrainment rate over large time scales.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
