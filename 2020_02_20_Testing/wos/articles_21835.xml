We report that the flows now show traces of the mid-latitude acceleration that is expected to become the main equatorwardmoving branch of the zonal flow pattern for Cycle 25. Based on the current position of this branch, we speculate that the onset of widespread activity for Cycle 25 is unlikely to be earlier than the middle of 2019.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
