Te and Ne were negatively correlated in most of the low and middle latitude regions at similar to 10:30 solar local time (LT). In these regions, photoelectron heating of the electrons was balanced by cooling through collisions with the ions. The negative correlation became weaker at midlatitudes, due to the increasing influence of heat conduction. The correlation was negative in most seasons during the daytime except at high latitudes in the northern winter, where a positive correlation occurred. There were wave-like longitudinal structures in Ne and Te around the geomagnetic equator, but they had different patterns in the day and the night. However, no obvious longitudinal variations in the correlation were associated with these structures. A positive correlation occurred near the magnetic equator at similar to 22:30 LT, which depended on thermal equilibrium between the electrons, ions, and neutrals. A negative correlation occurred at midlatitudes. Around the September equinox, at night around the magnetic equator, the positive correlation had a wider latitudinal range. At midlatitudes, a negative correlation occurred in smaller areas than it did around the March equinox. Around the December solstice the direct nighttime coupling between Ne and Te was weaker than it was around the June solstice. The negative correlation depends on the collisions between the electrons and the ions and the heating source.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
