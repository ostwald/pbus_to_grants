Previous studies suggest that both of these features are associated with coherent subkilometer-scale vortices. Here, over 100 000 virtual dropsonde trajectories are examined within a large-eddy simulation (31.25-m horizontal grid spacing) of a category 5 hurricane in order to gain insight into the nature of these features and to better understand and interpret dropsonde observations. At such a high resolution, profiles of wind speed and vertical velocity from the virtual sondes are difficult to distinguish from those of real dropsondes. PDFs of the strength of updrafts and wind gusts compare well between the simulated and observed dropsondes, as do the respective range of heights over which these features are found. Individual simulated updrafts can be tracked for periods of up to several minutes, revealing structures that are both coherent and rapidly evolving. It appears that the updrafts are closely associated with vortices and wind speed maxima, consistent with previous studies. The peak instantaneous wind gusts in the simulations (up to 150 m s(-1)) are substantially stronger than have ever been observed. Using the virtual sondes, it is demonstrated that the probability of sampling such extremes is vanishingly small, and it is argued that actual intense TCs might also be characterized by gusts of these magnitudes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
