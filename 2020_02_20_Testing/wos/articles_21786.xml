Due to limited availability of observational data, it is difficult to understand/estimate the impact of dust aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget in detail. This study, applies a regional model, Weather Research and Forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem), to investigate the impact of an intense dust storm that originated over the Arabian peninsula during 01-02 April 2015 and transported towards the Indian subcontinent by the westerly winds. Two identical numerical experiments are designed, each for 15 days, one with and another without dust aerosols, to estimate the impact of the dust storm over the Indian subcontinent and adjoining regions. WRF-Chem model reproduced the spatial, temporal as well as the vertical distribution of dust plume reasonably well.</p><p>Model results show significant changes in aerosol optical, physical and radiative properties due to the dominance of coarse mode aerosols in the atmosphere during the dust storm. Analysis of vertical profiles of particulate matter (PM10) concentration reveals the presence of dust aerosols extending from the surface to altitudes as high as 3-4 km during the dust storm period. The dust storm induced a cooling effect at the surface via reduction in shortwave (SW) radiative flux. A substantial decrease in temperature is also seen at 850 hPa due to dust, indicating a significant impact of dust layer on the atmospheric temperature profile. Atmospheric heating due to dust aerosols in the SW region is found to be compensated up to a large extent by longwave (LW) cooling effect of dust. The net dust induced radiative perturbation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) over different regions is negative and varied from -2.49 to -0.34 Wm(-2), while it is in the range of -0.62 to + 0.32 W-2 at the surface.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
