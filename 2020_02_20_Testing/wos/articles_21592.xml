We assess source contributions and evaluate the utility of using aircraft measured CO and NOy relationships to constrain emission inventories. We derive ambient and modeled CO:NOy ratios that have previously been interpreted to represent CO:NOy ratios in emissions from local sources. Modeled and measured CO:NOy are similar; however, measured CO:NOy has much more daily variability than modeled values. Sector-based tagging shows that regional transport, on-road gasoline vehicles, and nonroad equipment are the major contributors to modeled CO mixing ratios in the Baltimore area. In addition to those sources, on-road diesel vehicles, soil emissions, and power plants also contribute substantially to modeled NOy in the area. The sector mix is important because emitted CO:NOx ratios vary by several orders of magnitude among the emission sources. The model-predicted gasoline/diesel split remains constant across all measurement locations in this study. Comparison of CO:NOy to emitted CO:NOy is challenged by ambient and modeled evidence that free tropospheric entrainment, and atmospheric processing elevates ambient CO:NOy above emitted ratios. Specifically, modeled CO:NOy from tagged mobile source emissions is enhanced 5-50% above the emitted ratios at times and locations of aircraft measurements. We also find a correlation between ambient formaldehyde concentrations and measured CO:NOy suggesting that secondary CO formation plays a role in these elevated ratios. This analysis suggests that ambient urban daytime CO:NOy values are not reflective of emitted ratios from individual sources.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
