Coincident in situ measurements were selected to compare the MLS V2.2 and V3.3 WV and ozone profiles for understanding the applicability of the two version MLS products over the region. MLS V2.2 and V3.3 WV profiles respectively show their differences within -2.2 +/- 15.7% (n=74) and 0.3 +/- 14.9% (n=75) in the stratosphere at and above 82.5 hPa. Accordingly, at 100 hPa, the altitude approaching the tropopuase height, differences are within 9.8 +/- 46.0% (n=18) and 23.0 +/- 45.8% (n=17), and they are within 21.5 +/- 90.6% (n=104) and 6.0 +/- 83.4% (n=99) in upper troposphere. The differences of MLS ozone are within -11.7 +/- 16.3% (n=135, V2.2) and 15.6 +/- 24.2% (n=305, V3.3) at and above 82.5 hPa. At 100 hPa, they are within -3.5 +/- 54.4% (n=27) and -8.7 +/- 41.6% (n=38), and within 18.0 +/- 79.1% (n=47) and 34.2 +/- 76.6% (n=160) in the upper troposphere. The relative difference of MLS WV and ozone profile has significant oscillation and scatter at upper troposphere and lower stratosphere partly due to the stronger gradients of WV and ozone concentrations here as well the linear interpolation of sonde data for the intercomparison. At and below 70 hPa, the relative differences of MLS ozone are significantly larger over Lhasa during the Tibetan Plateau "ozone valley" season, which is also the Asian Summer Monsoon period. The MLS ozone differences over the three sites are similar in their vertical distributions during that period. A simple linear correlation analysis between MLS and sonde profiles indicates that the sensitivity of MLS profile products is related to concentrations at each pressure level. The MLS V3.3 product sensitivity is slightly improved for WV at and above 82.5 hPa, whereas it is not obvious for ozone. The possible factors contributing to the differences of the MLS profile products of WV and ozone are discussed.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
