The 2.5 degrees NCEP-NCAR reanalysis is used to construct composite analyses of all 1979-2009 recurving WNP TCs and of subsets that undergo strong and weak TC-extratropical flow interactions.</p><p>Findings indicate that recurving WNP TCs are associated with the amplification of a preexisting Rossby wave train (RWT) that disperses downstream and modifies the large-scale flow pattern over North America. This RWT affects approximately 240 degrees of longitude and persists for approximately 10 days. Recurving TCs associated with strong TC-extratropical flow interactions are associated with a stronger extratropical flow response than those associated with weak TC-extratropical flow interactions. Compared with weak interactions, strong interactions feature a more distinct upstream trough, stronger and broader divergent outflow associated with stronger midlevel frontogenesis and forcing for ascent over and northeast of the TC, and stronger upper-level PV frontogenesis that promotes more pronounced jet streak intensification. During strong interactions, divergent outflow helps anchor and amplify a downstream ridge, thereby amplifying a preexisting RWT from Asia that disperses downstream to North America. In contrast, during weak interactions, divergent outflow weakly amplifies a downstream ridge, such that a RWT briefly amplifies in situ before dissipating over the western-central North Pacific.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
