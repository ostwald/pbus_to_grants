The dependence of the solution on resolution and diffusivity is studied. For a grid spacing of less than 350 km, the rms magnetic field strength near the base of the convection zone reaches 95% of the equipartition field strength (i.e., magnetic and kinetic energy are comparable). For these solutions the Lorentz force feedback on the convection velocity is found to be significant. The velocity near the base of the convection zone is reduced to 50% of the hydrodynamic one. In spite of the significant decrease of the convection velocity, the reduction in the enthalpy flux is relatively small, since the magnetic field also suppresses the horizontal mixing of the entropy between up- and downflow regions. This effect increases the amplitude of the entropy perturbation and makes convective energy transport more efficient. We discuss potential implications of these results for solar global convection and dynamo simulations.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
