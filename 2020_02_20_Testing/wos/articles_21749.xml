We present data from Chews Ridge, a remote mountaintop site in California, in February-September 2012, which identifies separate Asian dust and Asian combustion aerosol signals and quantifies exogenous ozone. We use positive matrix factorization of size-fractionated aerosol X-ray fluorescence data and Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-208/Pb-207 isotope measurements to isolate aerosol signals of Asian origins and find good agreement between both types source attribution techniques. Power spectra of Asian dust and Asian combustion signals reveal two distinct peaks, one seasonal (similar to 90days) and one monthly (similar to 25-30days). Overall, 89% of the Asian dust signal occurs in March-May, compared with June-September, whereas only 51% of the Asian combustion signal occurs in March-May. Nearly half the Pb observed at Chews Ridge was derived from Asia (46%; 8.3% from Asian dust, 23% from Asian combustion, and 15% of the Asian Pb signal was not explained by the positive matrix factorization). A positive correlation between deseasonalized ozone concentrations and the Asian factors suggests that ozone is elevated by 6.30.8ppb due to transpacific transport. Scanning mobility particle size spectra were also measured from May to September and indicate that new particles are often produced and grow throughout the afternoon during onshore flow. We hypothesize that particle nucleation on the windward edge of the continent is an important source of new particles.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
