The mesoscale cycling experiment for the continuous ensemble data assimilation was verified against independent surface mesonet observations and demonstrated the positive impact on short-range forecasts over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) domain throughout the month-long period of June 2008. The EnKF assimilation of surface observations was found useful for systematically improving the simulation of the depth and the structure of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the reduction of surface bias errors. These benefits were extended above PBL and resulted in a better precipitation forecast for up to 12 h. With the careful specification of observation errors, not only the reliability of the ensemble system but also the quality of the following forecast was improved, especially in moisture. In this retrospective case study of a squall line, assimilation of surface observations produced analysis increments consistent with the structure and dynamics of the boundary layer. As a result, it enhanced the horizontal gradient of temperature and moisture across the frontal system to provide a favorable condition for the convective initiation and the following heavy rainfall prediction in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Even with the assimilation of upper-level observations, the analysis without the assimilation of surface observations simulated a surface cold front that was much weaker and slower than observed.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
