In this study, we have developed a mechanistic model of leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation (LUNA) to predict photosynthetic capacity at the global scale under different environmental conditions. We adopt an optimality hypothesis to nitrogen allocation among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation and respiration. The LUNA model is able to reasonably capture the measured spatial and temporal patterns of photosynthetic capacity as it explains similar to 55% of the global variation in observed values of V-c,V-max25 and similar to 65% of the variation in the observed values of J(max25). Model simulations with LUNA under current and future climate conditions demonstrate that modeled values of V-c,V-max25 are most affected in high-latitude regions under future climates. ESMs that relate the values of V-c,V-max25 or J(max25) to plant functional types only are likely to substantially overestimate future global photosynthesis.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
