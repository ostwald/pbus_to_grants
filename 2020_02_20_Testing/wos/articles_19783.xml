The effects of vertical shear are approximated by a nonlinear slantwise overturning model based on Lagrangian conservation principles. Simulation of the April 2009 Madden-Julian oscillation event during the Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC) over the Indian Ocean using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model at 1.3-km grid spacing identifies self-similar properties for squall lines, MCSs, and superclusters embedded in equatorial waves. The slantwise overturning model approximates this observed self-similarity. The large-scale effects of MCSP are examined in two categories of GCM. First, large-scale convective systems simulated in an aquaplanet model are approximated by slantwise overturning with attention to convective momentum transport. Second, MCSP is utilized in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5.5 (CAM5.5), as tendency equations for second-baroclinic heating and convective momentum transport. The difference between MCSP and CAM5.5 is a direct measure of the global effects of organized convection. Consistent with TRMM measurements, the MCSP generates large-scale precipitation patterns in the tropical warm pool and the adjoining locale; improves precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ), and Maritime Continent regions; and affects tropical wave modes. In conclusion, the treatment of organized convection by MCSP is salient for the next generation of GCMs.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
