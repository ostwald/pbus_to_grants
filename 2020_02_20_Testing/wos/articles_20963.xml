We examine several network measures to quantify the spatiotemporal correlation patterns in the TEC data for winter and summer months in 2016. We find that significant structure exists in the correlation patterns, distinguishing the dayside and nightside ionosphere, and specific features in the high latitudes such as the polar cap and auroral oval, including the cusp and ionospheric foot points of magnetospheric boundary layers. These features vary with the IMF, exhibiting a strong dependence on the north-south direction and generally larger variations during the winter months in both hemispheres. Our exploratory results suggest that network analysis of TEC data can be used to study characteristic ionospheric spatial scales at high latitudes, thereby extending the utility of these data. We explore mesoscale and large scale (greater than tens of kilometers and greater than hundreds of kilometers, respectively) as a function of winter/summer season, hemisphere, and IMF direction and conclude that the relative importance of different ionospheric scales is not a constant relationship. Together with an identification of important areas of future work, our findings provide a foundation for the application of network analysis techniques to ionospheric TEC. Our results suggest that network analysis can reveal new physical connections in the ionospheric system.</p><p>Plain Language Summary Network analysis is a methodology used to investigate the structure and dynamics of a system by identifying objects (nodes) and connections between objects (edges). These methods originated in the social sciences in which people are the objects and connections are defined by the presence of a predefined relationship between people. Network analysis has since flourished and been used to provide new scientific discovery in a broad range of disciplines, including biological, engineering, and geophysical systems. We use this approach to investigate the near-Earth ionized space environment, the ionosphere. Performing a novel network analysis of total electron content (TEC) data, significant structure emerges. Notably, dayside and nightside ionospheric TEC effects are distinct. Further, within the dayside and nightside systems distinct regions emerge in response to space weather activity. We suggest that network analysis can provide significant new, and complementary, understanding of the Earth's space environment and outline important future directions. This work illustrates the importance of data-driven discovery to improve understanding of our space environment and underscores the broader theme of embracing data science in the discipline of heliophysics.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
