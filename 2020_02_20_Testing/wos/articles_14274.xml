Based on a non-dimensional Reynolds number (Re) Best number (X) approach that applies to atmospheric temperatures and pressures where these particles develop and fall, the authors develop a relationship that spans a wide range of particle sizes. The Re X relationship can be used to derive the terminal velocities of rimed particles for many applications. Earlier observations suggest that a "supercritical" Reynolds number is reached where the drag coefficient for large spherical ice hail drops precipitously and the terminal velocities increase rapidly. The authors draw on observations and model simulations for slightly roughened large ice particles that suggest that the critical Reynolds number is dampened and that the rapid increase in the terminal velocity of smooth spherical ice particles rarely occurs for natural hailstones.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
