By analyzing simulations from a unique Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) project, it is shown that the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) is primarily an internally generated oceanic variability, while the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) may be an oceanic variability generated by internal oceanic processes and modulated by external forcing in the twentieth century. Although the observed relationship between IPO and the Yangtze-Huaihe River valley (YHRV) summer rainfall in China is well simulated in both the preindustrial control and the twentieth-century ensemble simulation, none of the twentieth-century ensemble members can reproduce the observed time evolution of both the IPO and YHRV rainfall because of the unpredictable nature of IPO on multidecadal time scales. On the other hand, although CESM-LE cannot reproduce the observed relationship between the AMO and Huanghe River valley (HRV) summer rainfall of China in the preindustrial control simulation, this relationship in the twentieth-century simulations is well reproduced, and the chance of reproducing the observed time evolution of both AMO and HRV rainfall is about 30%, indicating the important role of the interaction between the internal processes and the external forcing to realistically simulate the AMO and HRV rainfall.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
