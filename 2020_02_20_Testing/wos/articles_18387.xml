Here, these effects are separated, using the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM-LME), by examination of ensemble realizations with distinct posteruption ENSO responses. Hydroclimate anomalies in monsoon Asia and the western United States resemble the El Nino teleconnection pattern after "Tropical'' and "Northern'' eruptions, even when ENSO-neutral conditions are present. This pattern results from Northern Hemisphere (NH) surface cooling, which shifts the intertropical convergence zone equatorward, intensifies the NH subtropical jet, and suppresses the Southeast Asian monsoon. El Nino events following an eruption can then intensify the ENSO-neutral hydroclimate signature, and El Nino probability is enhanced two boreal winters following all eruption types. Additionally, the eruption-year ENSO response to eruptions is hemispherically dependent: the winter following a Northern eruption tends toward El Nino, while Southern volcanoes enhance the probability of La Nina events and Tropical eruptions have a very slight cooling effect. Overall, eruption-year hydroclimate anomalies in CESM disagree with the proxy record in both Southeast Asia and North America, suggesting that model monsoon representation cannot be solely responsible. Possible explanations include issues with the model ENSO response, the spatial or temporal structure of volcanic aerosol distribution, or data uncertainties.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
