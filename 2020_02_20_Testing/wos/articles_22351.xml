This model has numerous complexities that allow it to represent some of the most important nonlinearities associated with stratospheric SO2 injection, including aerosol microphysical growth and stratospheric chemistry. The studies described herein represent the steps toward and first attempt in a state-of-the-art climate model to use solar geoengineering to meet multiple simultaneous objectives via SO2 injection at multiple locations. First, a set of simulations was carried out to better understand the response of the model to variations in latitude, altitude, and amount of sulfur dioxide injections. Subsequently, in a century-long simulation, a feedback algorithm was employed to meet specific objectives and manage uncertainty, wherein the injection amount at each location was adjusted every model year. Most of the analyses contained in this special issue focus on surface climate and stratospheric changes in the simulations. In addition, 20 ensemble members of the feedback simulation have been carried out and provided to the community (the Geoengineering Large Ensemble) to expand the scope of analyses to low signal-to-noise ratio fields, including regional effects, impacts assessment, and extreme events. The demonstration provided by these simulations is a step toward understanding the space of achievable climate objectives via solar geoengineering or, phrased differently, determining what solar geoengineering can do and what it cannot do.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
