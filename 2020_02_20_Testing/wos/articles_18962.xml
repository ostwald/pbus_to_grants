The tethered balloon and surface measurement sites were located at Edgewood, MD and Smith Point, TX. The balloon profiles are used to connect aircraft data from the lowest portion of NASA's P-3B spirals (300 m AGL) to the surface thus creating complete profiles from the surface to 3-5 km AGL. The highest concentrations of surface ozone at these coastal sites resulted from mean flow transport of polluted air over an adjacent body of water followed by advection back over land several hours later, due to a bay or gulf breeze. Several meteorological processes including horizontal advection, vertical mixing, thermally direct circulation (i.e., bay, gulf, and, sea breezes) combined with chemical processes like photochemical production and deposition played a role in the local ozone maxima. Several small-scale, but highly polluted layers from the Chesapeake Bay advected landward over Edgewood, MD. The Houston Metro area was subject to large-scale recirculation of emissions from petrochemical sources by the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay breezes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
