Li and R. E. Carbone, the association of tropical rainfall with SST structure is further explored, with emphasis on the MJO passband. Analyses include the tropical Indian Ocean, Maritime Continent, and tropical western Pacific regions. The authors examine the anomalies of and correlations between SST structure, the frequency of rainfall events, and rainfall amount. Based on detailed examination of a 49-month time series, all findings are statistical inferences and interpretations consistent with established theory.</p><p>The statistical inferences are broadly consistent with a pivotal role played by the convergent Laplacian of SST together with an expected, but somewhat indirect, role of SST itself. The main role of SST in the MJO passband appears limited to production of moist static energy, which is highly correlated with cumulative precipitation, yet bears a decidedly conditional relationship to the occurrence of rainfall. If rain occurs, then more rain is likely over warmer SST. The convergent Laplacian of SST is strongly associated with the onset of rainfall, apparently through its capacity to induce vertical air motion with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome convective inhibition in a conditionally unstable troposphere. The convergent Laplacian of SST is directly associated with the location and the variability of rainfall event frequency while having a less direct relationship to cumulative rainfall. These nuanced interpretations of rainfall forcing by the Laplacian of SST, and conditional modulation of cumulative rainfall by SST, may underlie systematic errors in highly parameterized models as a consequence of variable asymmetry in the field of Laplacian anomalies.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
