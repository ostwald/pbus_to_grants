The analysed data, collected by a WINDCUBE (TM) v1 in a wind park in Austria, is compared to WINDCUBE (TM) v1 and sonic data from the WINd Turbine Wake EXperiment Wieringermeer (WINT-WEX-W). Although turbulence measurements with a WINDCLJBE (TM) v1 are limited to a specific length scale, processed measurements above this threshold are in a good agreement with sonic anemometer data. In contrast to the commonly used turbulence intensity, the calculation of TKE not only provides an appropriate measure of turbulence intensities but also gives an insight into its origin. The processed data show typical wake characteristics, as flow decelerations, turbulence enhancement and wake rotation. By comparing these turbulence characteristics to other turbulent structures in the atmospheric boundary layer, we found that convection driven eddies in the surface layer have similar turbulence characteristics as turbine wakes, which makes convective weather situations relevant for wind turbine fatigue considerations.
