It was found that the H' and N-e had profound responses to solar flares. The results showed a sharp decrease in the H' from 76 to 80 km during the non-flare period to nearly 58 km with flares, and a sudden increase in the N-e from below 4x 10(8) m(3) in non-flare period to 1.8x 10(9) m(3) during 13 M-level flares. The behavior of N-e was strongly and positively correlated with the variation of the X-ray flux, with the largest coefficient being 0.93, while the changes of H' exhibited a strongly negative correlation of -0.96 with that of the X-ray flux. Moreover, variations of H' and Delta N-e depended on not only the flare level, but also upon the onset time and duration of flare.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
