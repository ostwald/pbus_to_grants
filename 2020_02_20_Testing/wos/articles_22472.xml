Horizontal inhomogeneity of real atmosphere results in representativeness errors of retrieved profiles. In most cases these errors increase with a decrease of vertical scales of atmospheric structures and may not allow one to fully utilize the physical resolution of RO. Also, GPS RO-retrieved profiles are affected by observational noise of different types, which, in turn, affect the representation of small-scale atmospheric structures. This study investigates the effective resolution and optimal smoothing of GPS RO-retrieved temperature profiles using high-pass filtering and cross correlation with collocated high-resolution radiosondes. The effective resolution is a trade-off between representation of real atmospheric structures and suppression of observational noise, which varies for different latitudes (15 degrees S-75 degrees N) and altitudes (10-27 km). Our results indicate that at low latitudes the effective vertical resolution is about 0.2 km near the tropical tropopause layer and about 0.5 km in the lower stratosphere. The best resolution of 0.1 km is at the cold-point tropical tropopause. The effective resolutions at the midlatitudes are slightly worse than at low latitudes, varying from similar to 0.2 to 0.6 km. At high latitudes, the effective resolutions change notably with altitude from similar to 0.2 km at 10-15 km to similar to 1.4 km at 22-27 km. Our results suggest that the atmospheric inhomogeneity plays an important role in the representation of the vertical atmospheric structures by RO measurements.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
