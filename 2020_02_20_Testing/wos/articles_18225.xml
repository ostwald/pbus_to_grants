The overall concept in the potential creation of extra area effects from seeding is illustrated with respect to the hydrologic cycle, which includes both dynamical and microphysical processes. For the first time, results were synthesized from five operational and research weather modification experiments, including winter orographic snowpack enhancement and summer experiments to enhance rainfall. One of the most surprising aspects of these results is that extra area seeding effects on precipitation appear to be uniformly positive (5-15% increases, perhaps greater for some convective systems) for both winter and summer seeding projects examined in this paper. The spatial extent of the positive extra area seeding effects may extend to a couple hundred kilometers for winter orographic seeding projects and summer convective seeding projects (such as North Dakota, Texas, Thailand). Both microphysical and dynamical effects of seeding appear to be contributors to these extra area effects. Future work needs to incorporate larger data sets from some of the larger more sustained projects with advanced cloud models and tracer experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
