Uniformly stratified flow past a single mountain is examined.</p><p>Depending on background stratification and mountain width, different wave regimes are simulated, from weakly to strongly nonlinear and from hydrostatic to non-hydrostatic. Acting in conjunction with surface friction, mountain waves cause the boundary layer to separate from the ground, causing the development of atmospheric rotors in the majority of the simulated flows.</p><p>The rotors with largest vertical extent and strongest reverse flow near the ground are found to develop when the wave field is nonlinear and moderately non-hydrostatic, in line with linear theory predictions showing that the largest wave amplitudes develop in such conditions. In contrast, in near-hydrostatic flows boundary-layer rotors form even if the wave amplitude predicted by linear theory is relatively small. In such cases, rotors appear to be decoupled from the wave field aloft by low-level wave breaking. In fact, rotor formation is caused by short-wavelength modes propagating horizontally along an elevated and stably stratified jet below the neutrally stratified wave-breaking region. Once formed, atmospheric rotors trigger non-hydrostatic wave modes that can penetrate through the finite-depth neutral layer above the jet and propagate into the free atmosphere.</p><p>In all simulated cases, non-hydrostatic effectsi.e. sharp vertical accelerationsappear to be essential for rotor formation, regardless of the degree of hydrostaticity in the primary wave field.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
