This demand is fueled by findings that improved representation of land-state help improve rainfall/flood prediction. Here we report on the development of a high-resolution (4 km and 3 hourly) SM/ST product for 2001-2014 during Indian monsoon seasons (June-September). First, the quality of atmospheric fields from five reanalysis sources was examined to identify realistic forcing to a land data assimilation system (LDAS). The evaluation of developed SM/ST against observations highlighted the importance of quality forcing fields. There is a significant relation between the forcing error and the errors in the SM/ST. A combination of forcing fields was used to develop 14-years of SM/ST data. This dataset captured inter-annual, intr-aseasonal, and diurnal variations under different monsoon conditions. When the mesoscale model was initialized using the SM/ST data, improved simulations of heavy rain events was evident, demonstrating the value of the data over IMR.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
