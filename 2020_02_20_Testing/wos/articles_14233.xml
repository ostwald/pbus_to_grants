The methodology for deriving these optical models is based on microphysical data from 11 field campaigns using a variety of in situ probes, and incorporates a correction to mitigate the impact of ice particles that shatter at the probe inlets. The models are also based on a new library of ice habit single scattering properties developed for plates, droxtals, hollow and solid columns, hollow and solid bullet rosettes, an aggregate of solid columns, and a small/large aggregate of plates. Three sets of models are developed that assume the use of solid columns only, the aggregate of solid columns only, and a general habit mixture that incorporates all the habits. The consistency of the resulting models is explored. While the general habit mixture provides consistency with in situ microphysical measurements and the closest agreement with polarized reflectivities observed by the POLDER instrument on the PARASOL satellite, the aggregate of severely roughened solid columns provides the closest agreement between solar and infrared optical thicknesses. Finally, spectral results are presented for the shortwave and longwave models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
