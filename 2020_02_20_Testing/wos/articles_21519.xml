The first specified dynamics WACCM-X v.2.0 results are compared with several data sets, and with the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM), during the deep solar minimum year. Comparisons with Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite of temperature and zonal wind in the lower thermosphere show that WACCM-X reproduces the seasonal variability of tides remarkably well, including the migrating diurnal and semidiurnal components and the nonmigrating diurnal eastward propagating zonal wavenumber 3 component. There is overall agreement between WACCM-X, TIE-GCM, and vertical drifts observed by the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS) satellite over the magnetic equator, but apparent discrepancies also exist. Both model results are dominated by diurnal variations, while C/NOFS observed vertical plasma drifts exhibit strong temporal variations. The climatological features of ionospheric peak densities and heights (NmF(2) and hmF(2)) from WACCM-X are in general agreement with the results derived from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) data, although the WACCM-X predicted NmF(2) values are smaller, and the equatorial ionization anomaly crests are closer to the magnetic equator compared to COSMIC and ionosonde observations. This may result from the excessive mixing in the lower thermosphere due to the gravity wave parameterization. These data-model comparisons demonstrate that WACCM-X can capture the dynamic behavior of the coupled atmosphere and ionosphere in a climatological sense.</p><p>Plain Language Summary The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) is a numerical model of entire atmosphere, from the surface to around 600 km in altitude. Recent enhancements to WACCM-X include a fully coupled ionosphere, including electric field effects and ion transport. WACCM-X results are compared with several datasets, and with a predecessor, the TIE-GCM during a very low solar activity year 2008. Comparisons with wind and temperature measurements by the TIMED satellite show that WACCM-X reproduces the seasonal variability of atmospheric tides remarkably well. There is overall agreement between WACCM-X, TIE-GCM, and vertical ion motions observed by the C/NOFS satellite over the magnetic equator, but apparent discrepancies also exist among them. The climatological features of ionospheric peak densities and heights from WACCM-X are in general agreement with results derived from COSMIC data, although the WACCM-X-predicted peak values are smaller, and the equatorial ionosphere has bands of enhancement that are closer to the magnetic equator compared to COSMIC and ionosonde observations. These data-model comparisons demonstrate that WACCM-X can capture the basic climate and variation of the coupled atmosphere and ionosphere.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
