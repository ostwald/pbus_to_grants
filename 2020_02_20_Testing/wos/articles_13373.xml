The Walker cell emerges as the time-averaged statistical steady state with a prescribed sinusoidal sea surface temperature (SST) pattern with a mean temperature of 301.15 K and a horizontal variation of 4 K. The circulation exhibits intraseasonal variability on a time scale of about 20 days with quasi-periodic intensification of the circulation and broadening of the convective regime. This variability is closely tied to synoptic-scale systems associated with expansion and contraction of the Walker circulation. An index for the low-frequency variability is developed using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and by regressing various dynamic fields on this index. The low-frequency oscillation has four main stages: a suppressed stage with strengthened midlevel circulation, an intensification phase, an active phase with strong upper-level circulation, and a weakening phase. Various physical processes occurring at these stages are discussed as well as the impact of organized convective systems on the large-scale flow.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
