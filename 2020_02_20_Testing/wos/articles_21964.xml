The goal of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of position forecasts for three TCs within deformation wind fields [Debby (2012), Joaquin (2015), and Lionrock (2016)] using the ensemble-based sensitivity technique applied to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble forecasts. In all three cases, the position forecasts are sensitive to uncertainty in the steering wind within 500 km of the 0-h TC position. Subsequently, the TC moves onto either side of the axis of contraction due to the ensemble perturbation steering flow. As a TC moves away from the saddle point, the ensemble members subsequently experience different ensemble-mean steering winds, which act to move the TC away from the ensemble-mean TC position along the axis of dilatation. By contrast, the position forecasts appear to exhibit less sensitivity to the steering wind more than 500 km from the initial TC position, even though the TC may interact with these features later in the forecast. Furthermore, forecasts initialized at later times are characterized by significantly lower position errors and uncertainty once it becomes clear on which side of the axis of contraction the TC will move. These results suggest that TCs in deformation steering flow could be inherently unpredictable and may benefit from densely sampling the near-storm steering flow and TC structure early in their lifetimes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
