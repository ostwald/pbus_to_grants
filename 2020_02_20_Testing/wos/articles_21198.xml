Sound fields recorded on board the aircraft and by an array of microphones on the ground are compared and converted to sound speed estimates for the ray paths intersecting the intervening medium. Tomographic inversion is then used to transform these sound speed values into two-dimensional profiles of virtual temperature and wind vector, which enables the atmosphere to be visualized and monitored over time. The wind vector and temperature estimates are compared to measurements taken by a collocated midrange Doppler sodar and sensors on board the aircraft. Large-eddy simulations of daytime atmospheric boundary layers and error models of the tomographic inversion and sodar are also used to assess the magnitude and nature of anticipated differences. Both the simulations and field trials data show similar levels of correspondence between the tomographically derived and independently observed measurements.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
