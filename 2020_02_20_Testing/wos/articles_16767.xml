This study made use of these RO data to study the morphology of ionosphere equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) statistically during 2006-2014. The ionospheric peak density (NmF2) and peak height (hmF2) derived from the RO electron density profiles as well as the derived magnetic latitude of both crests and trough, the trough width, and the crest-to-trough ratio (CTR) of NmF2 are analyzed systematically. The corresponding seasonal, local time, and solar activity variations and the hemispheric asymmetry are identified and discussed. Most morphology agree well with previous studies and could be explained by the corresponding variations of neutral wind/composition and ExB vertical drift. We also found some interesting features. During May-August, magnetic latitude of the trough could be up to 5 north of the equator especially around noontime, and the local time difference corresponding best developed EIA between both hemispheres could be up to similar to 6 h. Both crests even move equator-ward with the increase of solar activity in the morning sector except June solstice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
