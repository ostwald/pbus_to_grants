Changes and improvements have been made to the algorithm, relative to earlier versions, based on the first year of on-orbit result. The L1 calibration consists of two parts: first, the Level 1a (L1a) calibration converts the raw Level 0 delay Doppler maps (DDMs) of processed counts into received power in units of watts. Second, the L1a DDMs are then converted to Level 1b DDMs of bistatic radar cross section values by unwrapping the forward scattering model, which are then normalized by the surface scattering area to arrive an observation of sigma(0). An update to the bottom up term-by-term error analysis is also presented, using on-orbit results to better quantify the accuracy of the rolled-up L1 calibration. The error analysis considers uncertainties in all known input calibration parameters. Finally, a method for calibrating the time delay of CYGNSS measurements is presented.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
