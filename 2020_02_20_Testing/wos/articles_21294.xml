The MFLFM model is the first global simulation of Jupiter magnetosphere that captures the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in the critically important subsolar region. Observations indicate that Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices are found predominantly in the dusk sector. Our simulations explain that this distribution is driven by the growth of KHI modes in the prenoon and subsolar region (e.g., &gt;10 local time) that are advected by magnetospheric flows to the dusk sector. The period of density fluctuations at the dusk terminator flank (18 magnetic local time, MLT) is roughly 1.4 h compared with 7.2h at the dawn flank (6 MLT). Although the simulations are only performed using parameters of the Jupiter's magnetosphere, the results may also have implications for solar wind-magnetosphere interactions at other corotation-dominated systems such as Saturn. For instance, the simulated average azimuthal speed of magnetosheath flows exhibit significant dawn-dusk asymmetry, consistent with recent observations at Saturn. The results are particularly relevant for the ongoing Juno mission and the analysis of dawnside magnetopause boundary crossings for other planetary missions.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
