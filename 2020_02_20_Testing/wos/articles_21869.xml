They are essential in the western United States where precipitation is seasonal, and snowpack is needed to meet water demand. With anthropogenic climate change increasingly threatening mountain snowpack, there is a pressing need to better understand the driving climatological processes. However, the coarse resolution typical of modern global climate models renders them largely insufficient for this task, and signals a need for an advanced strategy. This paper continues the assessment of variable-resolution in the Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) in modeling mountain hydroclimatology to understand the role of grid-spacing at 55, 28, 14, and 7 km and microphysics, specifically the Morrison and Gettelman (2008, MG1, https://doi.org/10.1175/2008JCLI2105.1) scheme versus the Gettelman and Morrison (2015, MG2, https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00102.1) scheme. Eight VR-CESM simulations were performed from 1999 to 2015 with the F_AMIP_CAM5 component set, which couples the atmosphere-land models and prescribes ocean data. Refining horizontal grid-spacing from 28 to 7 km with the MG1 scheme did not improve the simulated mountain hydroclimatology. Substantial improvements occurred with the use of MG2 at grid-spacings &lt;= 28 km compared to MG1 as shown with subsequent statistics. Average SWE bias diminished by 9.4X, 4.9X, and 3.5X from 55 to 7 km. The range in minimum (maximum) DJF spatial correlations increased by 0.1-0.2 in both precipitation and SWE. Mountain windward/leeward distributions and elevation profiles improved across hydroclimate variables, however not always with model resolution alone. Disconcertingly, all VR-CESM simulations exhibited a systemic mountain cold bias that worsened with elevation and will require further examination.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
