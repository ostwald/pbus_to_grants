                            <p>Isoprene carries approximately half of the flux of non-methane
                                volatile organic carbon emitted to the atmosphere by the biosphere.
                                Accurate representation of its oxidation rate and products is
                                essential for quantifying its influence on the abundance of the
                                hydroxyl radical (OH), nitrogen oxide free radicals (NOx), ozone
                                (O-3), and, via the formation of highly oxygenated compounds,
                                aerosol. We present a review of recent laboratory and theoretical
                                studies of the oxidation pathways of isoprene initiated by addition
                                of OH, O-3, the nitrate radical (NO3), and the chlorine atom. From
                                this review, a recommendation for a nearly complete gas-phase
                                oxidation mechanism of isoprene and its major products is developed.
                                The mechanism is compiled with the aims of providing an accurate
                                representation of the flow of carbon while allowing quantification
                                of the impact of isoprene emissions on HOx and NOx free radical
                                concentrations and of the yields of products known to be involved in
                                condensed-phase processes. Finally, a simplified (reduced) mechanism
                                is developed for use in chemical transport models that retains the
                                essential chemistry required to accurately simulate isoprene
                                oxidation under conditions where it occurs in the atmosphere-above
                                forested regions remote from large NOx emissions.</p>
