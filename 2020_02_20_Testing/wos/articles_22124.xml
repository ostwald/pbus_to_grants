This study tackles that issue by diagnosing physical processes of tropical cyclone intensification in a moderately sheared environment using a 20-member ensemble of idealized simulations. Consistent with previous studies, the ensemble shows that the onset of intensification largely depends on the timing of vortex tilt reduction and symmetrization of precipitation. A new contribution of this work is a process-based analysis following a shear-induced midtropospheric vortex with its associated precipitation. This analysis shows that tilt reduction and symmetrization precede intensification because those processes are associated with a substantial increase in near-surface vertical mass fluxes and equivalent potential temperature. A vorticity budget demonstrates that the increased near-surface vertical mass fluxes aid intensification via near-surface stretching of absolute vorticity and free-tropospheric tilting of horizontal vorticity. Importantly, tilt reduction happens because of a vortex merger processnot because of advective vortex alignmentthat yields a single closed circulation over a deep layer. Vortex merger only happens after the midtropospheric vortex reaches upshear left, where the flow configuration favors near-surface vortex stretching, deep updrafts, and a substantial reduction of low-entropy fluxes. These results lead to the hypothesis that intensification under moderate shear happens if and when a restructuring process is completed, after which a closed circulation favors persistent vorticity spinup and recirculating warm, moist air parcels.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
