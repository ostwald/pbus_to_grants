The eddy-diffusivity scheme of Tiedtke (TDK) is evaluated, focusing on the dependency upon deep convection schemes. Drying and warming near the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and opposing effects above are observed. The height of PBL is reduced due to the increase of thermal stability near the PBL top. The weakened PBL turbulence is partly compensated with the increased downward solar radiation due to the reduction of low clouds. These effects are pronounced over the oceans, which leads to the modulation of tropical precipitation. It is found that the original TDK scheme shows similar behavior regardless of the choice of deep convection schemes. A revised TDK scheme that explicitly couples the PBL and shallow convection processes is proposed and evaluated. The proposed scheme generally improves the simulated climatology over the results with the original TDK scheme, along with further improvement in the case of the revised deep convection scheme. Our results indicate that the role of the shallow convection scheme needs to be carefully examined to improve the performance of atmospheric models, with a focus on modulated PBL and deep convection processes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
