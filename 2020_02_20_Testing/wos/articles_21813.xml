Herein, we extend our previous work on the cell perturbation (CP) method to nonneutral atmospheric boundary layers (ABLs). A modified Richardson number scaling is proposed to determine the amplitude of the potential temperature perturbations in stable ABLs, with Ri(m) approximate to -1.0 overall providing optimum turbulence transition to a fully developed state (fetch reduced by a factor of 4-5, compared to the unperturbed cases). In the absence of perturbations, turbulence onset is triggered by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, typically occurring in the vicinity of the low-level jet maximum. It is found that a turbulent length scale l = q(1/2)/N can be used tomore accurately estimate the optimum Ri(m), where q is the turbulence kinetic energy, and N is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. In convective ABLs, a perturbation amplitude based on mixed layer temperature variance scaling is proposed: sigma(theta). For that criterion to be optimum, the ratioU(ci)/w(*), where U-ci is the wind speed at the top of the capping inversion, and w(*) is the convective velocity scale, needs to be incorporated: sigma(theta) (U-ci/w(*)). This allows us to account for the competing roles of the surface thermal instability and the mean flow advection. For Uci/w* approximate to 10, the development fetch is reduced by a factor of approximate to 6, while when U-ci/w(*) less than or similar to 3, the use of the CP method does not provide a significant advantage in the ability to generate turbulence, provided a smooth mesoscale inflow.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
