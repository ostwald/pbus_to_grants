The result shows that (zeta) over bar increases with altitudes and displays clearly seasonal and interannual variability. In the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), at the latitudes between 20 degrees N and 20 degrees S, when (zeta) over bar strengthens (weakens) at equinoxes (solstices) the DW1 amplitude increases (decreases) simultaneously. Stronger maximum in March-April equinox occurs in both (zeta) over bar and the DW1 amplitude. Besides, a quasi-biennial oscillation of DW1 is also found to be synchronous with (zeta) over bar. The resembling spatial-temporal features suggest that (zeta) over bar in the upper tropic MLT probably plays an important role in modulating semiannual, annual, and quasi-biennial oscillations in DW1 at the same latitude and altitude. In addition, (zeta) over bar in the mesosphere possibly affects the propagation of DW1 and produces SAO of DW1 in the lower thermosphere. Thus, SAO of DW1 in the upper MLT may be a combined effect of (zeta) over bar both in the mesosphere and in the upper MLT, which models studies should determine in the future.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
