The different nowcasting models include a statistical forecasting model (StatCast), two satellite-based forecasting models [the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere Nowcast (CIRACast) and the Multisensor Advection-Diffusion Nowcast (MADCast)], and a numerical weather prediction model (WRF-Solar). It is important to better understand and assess the strengths andweaknesses of these short-range models to facilitate further improvements. To that end, each of thesemodels, including four WRF-Solar configurations, was evaluated for four case days in April 2014. For each model, the 15-min average predicted global horizontal irradiance (GHI) was compared with GHI observations from a network of seven pyranometers operated by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) in California. Each case day represents a canonical sky-cover regime for the SMUD region and thus represents different modeling challenges. The analysis found that each of the nowcasting models perform better or worse for particular lead times and weather situations. StatCast performs best in clear skies and for 0-1-h forecasts; CIRACast and MADCast perform reasonably well when cloud fields are not rapidly growing or dissipating; and WRF-Solar, when configured with a high-spatial-resolution aerosol climatology and a shallow cumulus parameterization, generally performs well in all situations. Further research is needed to develop an optimal dynamic blending technique that provides a single best forecast to energy utility operators.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
