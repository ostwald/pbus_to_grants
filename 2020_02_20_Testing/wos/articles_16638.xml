These simulations have been constructed so as to span the transition between solar-like differential rotation (DR; fast equator/slow poles) and "anti-solar" DR (slow equator/fast poles). Solar-like states of DR, which arise when convection is rotationally constrained, are characterized by a very different convective Reynolds stress (RS) than anti-solar regimes, wherein convection only weakly senses the Coriolis force. We find that the angular momentum transport by convective RS plays a central role in establishing the meridional flow profiles in these simulations. We find that the transition from single-celled to multi-celled MC profiles in strong and weak regimes of rotational constraint is linked to a change in the convective RS, which is a clear demonstration of gyroscopic pumping. Latitudinal thermal variations differ between these different regimes, with those in the solar-like regime conspiring to suppress a single cell of MC, whereas the cool poles and warm equator established in the anti-solar states tend to promote single-celled circulations. Although the convective angular momentum transport becomes radially inward at mid-latitudes in anti-solar regimes, it is the MC that is primarily responsible for establishing a rapidly rotating pole. We conclude with a discussion of how these results relate to the Sun, and suggest that the Sun may lie near the transition between rapidly rotating and slowly rotating regimes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
