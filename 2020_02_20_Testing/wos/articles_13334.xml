H is generated primarily by photolysis of water vapor and participates in a highly exothermic reaction with ozone. This reaction is a significant source of heat in the mesopause region and also creates highly vibrationally excited hydroxyl (OH) from which the Meinel band radiative emission features originate. Concentrations (cm(-3)) and volume mixing ratios of H are derived from observations of infrared emission from the OH (upsilon = 9+8, Delta upsilon = 2) vibration-rotation bands near 2.0 mu m made by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the NASA Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite. The algorithms for deriving day and night H are described herein. Day and night concentrations exhibit excellent agreement between 87 and 95 km. SABER H results also exhibit good agreement with observations from the Solar Mesosphere Explorer made nearly 30 years ago. An apparent inverse dependence on the solar cycle is observed in the SABER H concentrations, with the H increasing as solar activity decreases. This increase is shown to be primarily due to the temperature dependence of various reaction rate coefficients for H photochemistry. The SABER H data, coupled with SABER atomic oxygen, ozone, and temperature, enable tests of mesospheric photochemistry and energetics in atmospheric models, studies of formation of polar mesospheric clouds, and studies of atmospheric evolution via escape of hydrogen. These data and studies are made possible by the wide range of parameters measured simultaneously by the SABER instrument.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
