Data collected by the P-3B aircraft, ground-based Pandora spectrometers, Aura/OMI satellite instrument, and simulations for July 2011 from the CMAQ air quality model during this deployment provide a large and varied data set, allowing this problem to be approached from multiple perspectives. O-3 columns typically exhibited a statistically significant and high degree of correlation with surface data (R-2 &gt; 0.64) in the P-3B data set, a moderate degree of correlation (0.16 &lt; R-2 &lt; 0.64) in the CMAQ data set, and a low degree of correlation (R-2 &lt; 0.16) in the Pandora and OMI data sets. NO2 columns typically exhibited a low to moderate degree of correlation with surface data in each data set. The results of linear regression analyses for O-3 exhibited smaller errors relative to the observations than NO2 regressions. These results suggest that O-3 partial column observations from future satellite instruments with sufficient sensitivity to the lower troposphere can be meaningful for surface air quality analysis.
