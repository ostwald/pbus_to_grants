We derive wavelengths in air of 2.8427 +/- 0.00009 mu m and 2.8529 +/- 0.00008 mu m. One of these lines belongs to the 3p(5)3d F-3(3)degrees -&gt; 3p(5)3d F-3(4)degrees transition in Ar-like Fe IX. This appears to be the first detection of this transition from any source. Minimization of residual wavelength differences using both measured wavelengths, together with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) extreme ultraviolet wavelengths, does not clearly favor assignment to Fe IX. However, the shorter wavelength line appears more consistent with other observed features formed at similar temperatures to Fe IX. The transition occurs between two levels within the excited 3p(5)3d configuration, 429,000 cm(-1) above the ground level. The line is therefore absent in photo-ionized coronal-line astrophysical sources such as the Circinus Galaxy. Data from a Fourier transform interferometer (FTIR) deployed from Wyoming show that both lines are significantly attenuated by telluric H2O, even at dry sites. We have been unable to identify the longer wavelength transition.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
