Two experiments spanning 11 August-13 September 2008 were run over a domain featuring the Atlantic basin using a 6-h full cycling analysis and forecast system. Deterministic 72-h forecasts were initialized at 0000 and 1200 UTC for a comparison of forecast impact. The two experiments were configured identically with the exception of the inclusion of the MHS radiances (AMHS) in the second to isolate the impacts of the MHS radiance data. The results were verified against several sources, and statistical significance tests indicate the most notable differences are in the midlevel moisture fields. Both configurations were characterized by high moisture biases when compared to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim, also known as ERA-I) specific humidity fields, as well as precipitable water vapor from an observationally based product. However, the AMHS experiment has midlevel moisture fields closer to the ERA-I and observation datasets. When reducing the verification domain to focus on the subtropical and easterly wave regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, larger improvements in midlevel moisture at nearly all lead times is seen in the AMHS simulation. Finally, when considering tropical cyclone forecasts, the AMHS configuration shows improvement in intensity forecasts at several lead times as well as improvements at early to intermediate lead times for minimum sea level pressure forecasts.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
