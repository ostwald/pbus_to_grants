This comparison reveals discrepancies in the vertical profile of the rain DSDs for the stratiform region of the squall-line system observed on 12 June 2011 over Oklahoma. Based on numerical sensitivity analyses, this study addresses the bias at the top of the rain layer and the vertical evolution of the DSD properties (i.e., of D-m and N0*). In this way, the Thompson scheme is used to explore the sensitivity to the melting process. Moreover, using the Thompson and Morrison schemes, the sensitivity of the DSD vertical evolution to different breakup and self-collection parameterizations is studied. Results show that the DSDs are strongly dependent on the representation of the melting process in the Thompson scheme. In the Morrison scheme, the simulations with more efficient breakup reproduce the DSD properties with better fidelity. This study highlights how the inaccuracies in simulated D-m and N0* for both microphysics schemes can impact the evaporation rate, which is systematically underestimated in the model.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
