Forecasts are evaluated by using concepts from object-based approaches to compare the three-dimensional simulated reflectivity field with the reflectivity field as observed by radar. Results from analysis of both schemes reveals that forecasts generally perform well near the surface but differ considerably aloft both from observations and from each other. Forecasts are found to contain too many convective cores that are individually larger than in the observations, with at least double the number of observed convective cores reaching the midtroposphere (i.e., 4-8 km). Although the number of cores is overpredicted, WSM6 cores typically contain lower simulated reflectivity values than the observations, and the regions of highest reflectivity values do not extend far enough vertically. Conversely, Thompson cores are found to have significantly higher reflectivity values within cores, with the strongest intensities extending higher than in the observations and having magnitudes higher than any observed cores. Forecast reflectivity distributions within convective cells are found to contain more spread than in the observations. The study also assessed the uncertainty in simulated reflectivity calculations by using a second commonly utilized method to calculate simulated reflectivity. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the primary conclusions with each method are similar but the variability generated by using different simulated reflectivity calculations can be as pronounced as when using different microphysical schemes.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
