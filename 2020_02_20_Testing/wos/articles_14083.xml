The overall thermospheric and ionospheric changes induced by the QTDW are evaluated by running the model with and without QTDW forcing imposed at the model lower boundary. The dissipation of the westward propagating QTDW in the lower thermosphere causes westward mean wind acceleration and drives a poleward meridional circulation. The circulation induced by the QTDW, as determined by the difference between the mean wind patterns of a run with the QTDW and a base run without the QTDW, enhances the mixing of constituents in the lower thermosphere. Through molecular diffusion, the decrease of the O mixing ratio and the increase of the N-2 and O-2 mixing ratios propagate from the lower thermosphere into the upper thermosphere. As a result, the O/N-2 ratio near the ionospheric F-2 peak is reduced by about 16-20% at low and midlatitudes. This in turn produces an approximately 16-32% depletion in the F-2 peak electron density at low and midlatitudes. The simulated decrease of electron density during a QTDW event is in quantitative agreement with published observations. This work suggests a new major pathway for the traveling planetary wave from the lower atmosphere to affect the thermosphere and ionosphere via dissipation and mean wind acceleration.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
