Compared to the legacy Noah scheme coupled to BEP+BEM, this modeling system shows a better performance, decreasing the root-mean-square error of 2m air temperature to 1.9 degrees C for urban stations. The simulated AC electric loads in suburban and rural districts are significantly improved by introducing the urban class-dependent building cooled fraction. Analysis reveals that the observed AC electric loads in each district are characterized by a common double peak at 3p.m. and at 9p.m. local standard time, and the incorporation of more realistic AC working schedules helps reproduce the evening peak. Waste heat from AC systems has a smaller effect (similar to 1 degrees C) on the afternoon 2m air temperature than the evening one (1.5 similar to 2.4 degrees C) if AC systems work for 24h and vent sensible waste heat into air. Influences of AC systems can only reach up to similar to 400m above the ground for the evening air temperature and humidity due to a shallower urban boundary layer than daytime. Spatially varying maps of AC working schedules and the ratio of sensible to latent waste heat release are critical for correctly simulating the cooling electric loads and capturing the thermal stratification of urban boundary layer.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
