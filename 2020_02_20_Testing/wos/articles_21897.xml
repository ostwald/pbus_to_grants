Experiments are performed during high-impact weather events that were sampled as part of the NOAA Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Sensing Hazards with Operational Unmanned Technology (SHOUT) field campaigns in 2016: 1) three extratropical systems in February 2016 and 2) Hurricanes Matthew and Nicole in the western Atlantic. For these events, the benefits of GH observations under a satellite data gap scenario are also investigated. It is found that the assimilation of GH dropsondes reduces the track error for both Matthew and Nicole; the improvements are as high as 20% beyond 60 h. Additionally, the localized dropsondes reduce global forecast track error for four tropical cyclones by up to 9%. Results are mixed under a satellite gap scenario, where only Hurricane Matthew is improved from assimilated dropsondes. The improved storm track is attributed to a better representation of the steering flow and atmospheric midlevel pattern. For all cases, dropsondes reduce the root-mean-square error in temperature, relative humidity, wind, and sea level pressure by 3%-8% out to 96 h. Additional benefits from GH dropsondes are obtained for precipitation, with higher skill scores over the southeastern United States versus control forecasts of up to 8%, as well as for low-level parameters important for severe weather prediction. The findings from this study are preliminary and, therefore, more cases are needed for statistical significance.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
