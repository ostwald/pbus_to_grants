However, hybrid DA requires a separate ensemble DA to estimate the uncertainty in the deterministic variational DA, which can be suboptimal both technically and scientifically. A new framework called the ensemble variational integrated localized (EVIL) data assimilation addresses this inconvenience by updating the ensemble analyses using information from the variational deterministic system. The goal of EVIL is to encompass and generalize existing ensemble Kalman filter methods in a variational framework. Particular attention is devoted to the affordability and efficiency of the algorithm in preparation for operational applications.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
