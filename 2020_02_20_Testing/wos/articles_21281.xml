The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a high resolution atmospheric chemistry model to reproduce observed relationships between meteorology and high or extreme O-3. We employ regional coupled chemistry-transport model simulations to make three types of comparisons between simulated and observational data, comparing (1) tails of the O-3 response variable, (2) distributions of meteorological predictor variables, and (3) sensitivities of high and extreme O-3 to meteorological predictors. This last comparison is made using two methods: quantile regression, for the 0.95 quantile of O-3, and tail dependence optimization, which is used to investigate even higher O-3 extremes. Across all three locations, we find substantial differences between simulations and observational data in both meteorology and meteorological sensitivities of high and extreme O-3.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
