The measurement was conducted in an urban location from Nov. 16,2012 to Jan. 15,2013. During the period, the visibility varied from &gt;20 km to less than a kilometer, with a minimum visibility of 667 m, causing 16 haze occurrences. During the haze occurrences, the wind speeds were less than 1 m/s, and the concentrations of PM2.5 (particle matter with radius less than 2.5 mu m) were often exceeded 200 mu g/m(3). The correlation between PM2.5 concentration and visibility under different RH values shows that visibility was exponentially decreased with the increase of PM2.5 concentrations when RH was less than 80%. However, when RH was higher than 80%, the relationship was no longer to follow the exponentially decreasing trend, and the visibility maintained in very low values, even with low PM2.5 concentrations. Under this condition, the hygroscopic growth of particles played important roles, and a large amount of water vapor acted as particle matter (PM) for the reduction of visibility. The variations of meteorological parameters (RH, PBL heights, and WS (wind speed)), chemical species in gas-phase (CO, O-3, SO2, and N0x), and gas-phase to particle-phase conversions under different visibility ranges were analyzed. The results show that from high visibility (&gt;20 km) to low visibility (&lt;2 km), the averaged PBL decreased from 1.24 km to 0.53 km; wind speeds reduced from 1 m/s to 0.5 m/s; and CO increased from 0.5 ppmv to 4.0 ppmv, suggesting that weaker transport/diffusion caused the haze occurrences. This study also found that the formation of SPM (secondary particle matter) was accelerated in the haze events. The conversions between SO2 and SO4- as well as NOx to NO3- increased, especially under high humidity conditions. When the averaged RH was 70%, the conversions between SO2 and SO4- accounted for about 20% concentration of PM2.5, indicating that formation of secondary particle matter had important contribution for the haze occurrences in Beijing.
