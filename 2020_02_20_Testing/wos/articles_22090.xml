In this study the local spectral width (LSW) of RO signals, transformed to impact parameter representation, is used for the characterization of the uncertainty (random error) of retrieved bending angle and refractivity profiles. A large LSW has some correlation with the large mean difference (bias) of retrieved refractivity and bending angle from radiosondes and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses based on data from 2008 to 2014. An LSW-based quality control (QC) procedure is developed to eliminate low-quality (large random errors and biases) profiles from data assimilation. The LSW-based QC procedure is tested and evaluated in the assimilation of Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate RO data using the NCAR Data Assimilation Research Testbed and the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. Preliminary results, based on a 2-week data assimilation cycle, show that the LSW-based QC procedure improves water vapor analyses in the moist lower troposphere.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
