The exhaustive solution to this coupled DA problem calls for a covariance where all available measurements can influence all grid points in all fluids. Solution of such a large algebraic problem is computationally expensive, often calls for a substantial rewrite of existing fluid-specific DA systems, and, as shown in this paper, can be avoided.The proposed interface solver assumes that covariances between coupled measurements and target fluid are often close to null (e.g., between stratospheric observations and the deep ocean within a 6-h forecast cycle). In the interface solver, two separate DA solvers are run in parallel: one that produces an analysis solution in the atmosphere, and one in the ocean. Each system uses a coupled observation vector where in addition to resident measurements in the target fluid it also includes nonresident measurements in the coupled fluid that are likely to have significant influence on the analysis in the target fluid (interface measurements). An ensemble-based method is employed and a localization function for coupled ensembles is proposed. Using a coupled model for the Mediterranean Sea (in a twin setting), it is demonstrated that (i) the solution of the interface solver converges to the exhaustive solution and (ii) that in presence of poorly known error covariances, the interface solver can be configured to produce a more accurate solution than an exhaustive solver.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
