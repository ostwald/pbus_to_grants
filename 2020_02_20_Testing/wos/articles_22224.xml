This challenge is particularly acute at high latitudes where the effects of space weather are most direct and no reliable predictive capability exists. We take advantage of a large volume of data from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, increasingly sophisticated tools for data-driven discovery, and a machine learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) to develop a novel predictive model for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation. This work, to our knowledge, represents the first time an SVM model has been created to predict high-latitude phase scintillation. We use the true skill score to evaluate the SVM model and to establish a benchmark for high-latitude ionospheric phase scintillation prediction. The SVM model significantly outperforms persistence (i.e., current and future scintillation are identical), doubling the predictive skill according to the true skill score for a 1-hr lead time. For a 3-hr lead time, persistence is comparable to a random chance prediction, suggesting that the memory of the ionosphere in terms of high-latitude plasma irregularities is on the order of, or shorter than, a few hours. The SVM model predictive skill only slightly decreases between the 1- and 3-hr predictive tasks, pointing to the potential of this method. Our findings can serve as a foundation on which to evaluate future predictive models, a critical development toward the resolution of space weather impact on transionospheric radio signals.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
