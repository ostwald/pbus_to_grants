These impacts are typically difficult to assess because of natural variability of the simulated cloud field. The idea is to use two sets of thermodynamic variables driven by different microphysical schemes or by a single scheme with different parameters as applied here. The first set is coupled to the dynamics as in the standard model, and the second set is applied diagnostically that is, driven by the flow but without the feedback on the flow dynamics. Having the two schemes operating in the same flow pattern allows for extracting the impact with high confidence. For illustration, the method is applied to simulations of precipitating shallow convection applying a simple bulk representation of warm-rain processes. Because of natural variability, the traditional approach provides an uncertain estimate of the impact of cloud droplet concentration on the mean cloud-field rainfall even with an ensemble of simulations. In contrast, the impact is well constrained while applying the new methodology. The method can even detect minuscule changes of the mean cloud cover and liquid water path despite their large temporal fluctuations and different evolutions within the ensemble.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
