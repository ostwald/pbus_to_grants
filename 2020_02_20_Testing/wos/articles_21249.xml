The variation of zonal mean momentum flux of resolved gravity waves (with zonal wavelengths less than 1600 km) during SSW are qualitatively consistent with those obtained from parameterized studies, mainly caused by the change of filtering by the mean zonal wind. At high latitude in the winter hemisphere, stratospheric and mesospheric momentum fluxes vary rapidly during SSW, and their magnitudes decrease significantly following SSW, agreeing with satellite observations. Gravity waves are also found to vary as wave sources change. At tropical regions (especially in the summer hemisphere), convectively generated gravity waves increase due to enhanced deep convection following SSW. At higher latitudes, orographic waves vary during SSW as the wind changes extend from the stratosphere down into the troposphere. Gravity waves generated from adjustment of the polar jet also undegro significant changes during SSW. These changes lead to strong longitudinal variation of gravity waves.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
