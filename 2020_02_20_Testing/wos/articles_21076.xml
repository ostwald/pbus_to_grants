Observations indicated an increase of TP surface air temperature 3-4 days prior to extreme persistent precipitation events in southeastern China. NCEP reanalysis data revealed a significant low pressure anomaly in southern China and a high pressure anomaly in northern China during extreme persistent precipitation event periods. Using correlation analysis and random resampling nonparametric statistics, a typical PEPE event from 17 to 25 June 2010 was selected for numerical simulation. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model was used to investigate the impact of the TP's surface heating on the evolution of this event. Three contrasting WRF experiments were conducted with different surface heating strengths by changing initial soil moisture over the TP. Different soil conditions generate different intensities of surface sensible heat fluxes and boundary layer structures over the TP resulting in two main effects on downstream convective rainfall: modulating large-scale atmospheric circulations and modifying the water vapor transport at southern China. Increased surface heating in the TP strengthens a high pressure system over the Yangtze Plain, thereby blocking the northward movement of precipitation. It also enhances the water vapor transport from the South China Sea to southern China. The combined effects substantially increase precipitation over most of the southeastern China region.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
