Similar co-variability of primary production is also seen in the multiyear (1987-2007) integration of a coupled physical-biological model. Moreover, the modeled seasonal amplitudes of 10-meter chlorophyll-a concentrations at the EBS middle shelf mooring locations, computed using the canonical Redfield ratio and a mean carbon-to-chlorophyll-a ratio, are generally consistent with the in situ mooring measurements. The coupled physical-biological model simulation is used to examine the relative contributions of wind mixing, local nutrient recycling/regeneration, horizontal nutrient advection, and water-column stability to this co-variability. There is no significant correlation between the spring and fall surface wind mixing. Although wind mixing is an important mechanism for bringing nutrients in the lower water column to the surface layers, it is not the mechanism tying the two seasons' productivity together. Local regeneration/recycling of the nutrients initially fueling spring production is an important mechanism for spring-to-fall nutrient accumulation in the bottom layers at the middle shelf. Horizontal advection does not appear to be the dominant factor for supplying nutrients to the middle shelf during the spring-to-fall period. Fall primary production in the model is strongly influenced by the lower water-column stability/stratification. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of local recycling/regeneration of nutrients assimilated by spring phytoplankton bloom in linking together the spring and fall primary productions on EBS middle shelf.
