The wind-tunnel measurements are complimentary to the field measurements, and the dependence of the wind-tunnel mean-wind-component flow-distortion errors on wind direction agrees well with that of the field measurements. The field measurements exhibit significant overestimation of the crosswind variance and underestimation of the momentum flux with respect to an adjacent CSAT3 sonic, as well as a transfer of turbulent kinetic energy from the streamwise wind component to the cross-stream wind components. In contrast, we find attenuation of only a few percent in the vertical velocity variance and the vertical flux of sonic temperature. The attenuation of the fluxes appears to be caused to a large extent by decorrelation between the horizontal and vertical-velocity components and between the vertical velocity and sonic temperature. Additional flow distortion due to transducer shadowing reduces to some extent the overestimation, but also increases the underestimation of the IRGASON turbulence statistics.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
