One of these efforts comes from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The FAO effort involves combining satellite rainfall estimates and meteorological model outputs with station measurements. The algorithm of the FAO satellite rainfall estimates (FAO-RFE) is presented and evaluated by comparing with raingauge data and other satellite rainfall products over eastern and western parts of Africa. The evaluations were done at daily and ten-daily time scales. The FAO-RFE has shown significant improvement over the individual inputs. However, comparison of FAO-RFE with other satellite rainfall products has shown a slight improvement only over areas with good station input. The main weakness of the FAO-RFE is that it overestimates rainfall occurrences, which is attributed to the forecast product used in the algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
