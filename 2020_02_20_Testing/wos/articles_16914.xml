The SSW event strongly modified the pattern of polar and tropical stratospheric circulation. After termination of SSW, a new pattern emerged that prevailed for similar to 2-3 months. After SSW, a clear descending cold phase completely replaced the warm phase in the polar regions. During the warm phase, temperature increased to similar to 40 degrees C in stratosphere (&gt;30 km altitude) in the polar region (80 degrees N-90 degrees N), then it dropped down to 80 degrees C during the cold phase. Interestingly, new warm anomalies appeared over the tropical region during the cold phase at polar regions. Possible implications of these unusually warm and cold phases are demonstrated in this study. These phases altered significantly the cold point tropopause temperature and its height. SSW also affected the tropical atmospheric stability. Cross equatorial response (from northern to southern hemisphere) up to 40 degrees S was observed in the form of persisting anomalies as a consequence of the SSW event. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
