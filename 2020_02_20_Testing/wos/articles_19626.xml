This study aims to investigate the local time, seasonal, and solar cycle variations of the O/N2 longitudinal pattern in both hemispheres during daytime in solstices. The O/N-2 data used are from TIMED/Global Ultraviolet Imager observations made over a solar cycle for geomagnetically quiet conditions. The main findings are as follows:(1) The O/N-2 longitudinal patterns are generally similar during 10:00-14:00 LT and between solar minimum and maximum, although the O/N-2 values change with local time and solar cycle. (2) The winter O/N-2 subauroral enhancement is unexpectedly smaller in the longitudeswhere the magnetic pole is (near-pole longitudes), rather than in the longitudes far from the magnetic pole, especially during solar maximum, and consequently, the longitudinal pattern of O/N-2 depends on latitude in local winter. (3) The winter O/N-2 subauroral enhancement generally moves to more poleward latitudes during solar maximum, as compared to solar minimum. (4) At higher midlatitudes (similar to 45 degrees -60 degrees N and similar to 40 degrees-50 degrees S in geographic latitudes) in solar minimum, the winter-to-summer ratio of O/N-2 in each hemisphere has an obvious minimum in near-pole longitudes. This minimum becomes more evident during solar maximum. The National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model simulations indicate that in the winter hemisphere, the unexpected O/N-2 longitudinal pattern in higher midlatitudes is mainly associated with high-latitude Joule heating under the impact from ion convection and auroral precipitation.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
