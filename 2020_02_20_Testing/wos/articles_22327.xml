In this paper an improved radial velocity dealiasing scheme is presented and evaluated using observations from several S-band radars under the severe weather conditions of typhoons and hurricanes. This scheme, named Automated Dealiasing for Typhoon and Hurricane (ADTH), is a further development of the China New Generation Doppler Weather Radar (CINRAD) improved dealiasing algorithm (CIDA). The upgraded algorithm ADTH includes three modules designed to select the first radial from which the dealiasing process starts, to conduct a two-way multipass dealiasing, and to perform an error check for a final local dealiasing. The dealiasing algorithm is applied to two typhoon hurricane cases and four typhoon cases observed with radars from CINRAD, NEXRAD of the United States, and the Taiwan radar network for a continuous period of 12 h for each of the selected cases. The results show that ADTH outperforms CIDA for all of the test cases.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
