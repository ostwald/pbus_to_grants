In this paper, we propose an improved DCB estimation method (ZERO method) based on the assumption that the LEO-based TEC can reach zero and also optimize the parameter configuration in the commonly used least square method (LSQ method). In the improved ZERO method, the combination of the lower quartile minimum relative TEC during each orbital revolution with the daily minimum relative TEC gives a stable and reliable DCB estimation. For the LSQ method, the 3-TECU cutoff vertical TEC with 10. cutoff elevation is considered to offer a reasonable DCB estimation. Subsequently, Global Positioning System (GPS) observations from multiple LEO satellites at different altitudes are used to study the variability of the LEO DCBs. Our results revealed that the LEO DCBs underwent obvious long-term variation and periodic oscillations of months. Moreover, the CHAMP data illustrated that the long-term variation of LEO DCBs is partly associated with the GPS satellite replacement, and the periodic variation can be attributed to the variation of the hardware thermal status, represented by the receiver CPU temperature in this study.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
