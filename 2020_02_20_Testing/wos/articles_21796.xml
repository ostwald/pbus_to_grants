Although Murray's law and the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE) theories predict convergent scaling of conduit width and number, it is not known how conduit scaling is affected by habitat aridity or temperature.</p><p>We measured the scaling of leaf size, conduit width and conduit number within the leaves of 36 evergreen Angiosperms spanning a large range in aridity and temperature in eastern Australia.</p><p>Scaling of conduit width and number in midribs and 2 degrees veins did not differ across species and habitats (P &gt; 0.786), and did not differ from that predicted by Murray's law (P = 0.151). Leaf size was strongly correlated with the hydraulic radius of petiole conduits (r(2) = 0.83, P &lt; 0.001) and did not differ among habitats (P &gt; 0.064), nor did the scaling exponent differ significantly from that predicted by hydraulic theory (P = 0.086).</p><p>The maximum radius of conduits in petioles was positively correlated with the temperature of the coldest quarter (r(2) = 0.67; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting that habitat temperature restricts the occurrence of wide-conduit species in cold habitats.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
