Satellite measurements can provide a solution to this limitation, but the lack of sensitivity of satellites to O-3 within the boundary layer causes large uncertainties in satellite retrievals at the near-surface. The vertical variability of O-3 was investigated using ozonesondes collected as part of NASA's Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from COlumn and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) campaign during July 2011 in the Baltimore, MD/Washington D.C. metropolitan area. A subset of the ozonesonde measurements was corrected for a known bias from the electrochemical solution strength using new procedures based on laboratory and field tests. A significant correlation of O-3 over the two sites with ozonesonde measurements (Edgewood and Beltsville, MD) was observed between the mid-troposphere (7-10 km) and the near-surface (1-3 km). A linear regression model based on the partial column amounts of O-3 within these subregions was developed to calculate the near-surface O-3 using mid-tropospheric satellite measurements from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) onboard the Aura spacecraft. The uncertainties of the calculated near-surface O-3 using TES mid-tropospheric satellite retrievals and a linear regression model were less than 20 %, which is less than that of the observed variability of O-3 at the surface in this region. These results utilize a region of the troposphere to which existing satellites are more sensitive compared to the boundary layer and can provide information of O-3 at the near-surface using existing satellite infrastructure and algorithms.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
