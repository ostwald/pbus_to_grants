The WASP in WRF was specifically modified to simulate the emissions of both Agl and Indium oxide (In2O3) particles from ground-and aircraft-based generators and the associated interactions with hydrometeors. Validations of model results against available observations from soundings and SNOwpack TELemetry (SNOTEL) data show that WRF simulations reasonably capture the dynamics, the thermodynamics, and the precipitation patterns. The comparisons of deposited Ag and In concentrations between model results and observations, and the analyses of seeding effects and AgI seeding efficiencies show that: The simulated Ag mass concentrations inside the snow are similar to observations ranging mostly from 0 to 10(-9) kg kg(-1) and have high spatial correlations with observations in ground seeding cases (similar to 80%) but lower in airborne seeding (similar to 40%). The simulated Ag/In ratios range between 60 and 600 indicating that ice nucleation of Agl particle dominates the scavenging of Agl in incorporating Ag into the snow. The overall simulated seeding effect of the four cases is 6, increase in precipitation over the LES domain, which is similar to what was inferred from the observations for the entire experiment. The magnitude of the AgI seeding efficiency is one order higher in airborne seeding cases (similar to 10(10) kg kg(-1)) compared to ground seeding cases (similar to 10(9) kg kg(-1)).
