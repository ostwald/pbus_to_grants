The resulting data set shows a global mean, ocean-only trend in TPW of 0.436 kg/m(2) per decade (1.49% per decade), and a trend in the deep tropics (20 degrees S-20 degrees N) of 0.629 kg/m(2) per decade (1.503% per decade). The uncertainty in the merged TPW results is analyzed on multiple time and distance scales using a Monte Carlo approach. This analysis results in an uncertainty ensemble that can be used to evaluate the effects of construction uncertainty on any subsequent application of the data set. We compare the merged data set with measurements of TPW from ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System sensors on small islands. These comparisons show no systematic long-term drifts in the differences, and the observed differences were largely explained by our uncertainty analysis. As an example of the use of the uncertainty ensemble, we evaluate the increase in TPW over the Gulf of Mexico during summer months over 1988-2017.</p><p>Plain Language Summary Water vapor in the atmosphere is important for studying our changing climate because it is a contributor to the greenhouse effect, and the amount of vapor is expected to increase as the planet warms. Measurements made by polar orbiting satellites cover the entire globe, making them especially useful for global climate studies. A certain type of satellite sensor, a microwave imaging radiometer, can accurately measure the total amount of vapor in the atmosphere. Since 1988, more than a dozen such instruments have been operated by different agencies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. In this work, we combine the results from 11 of these sensors into a single long record that can be used to investigate climate change, taking care to remove any small differences in calibration between the different sensors. The record clearly shows that the amount of vapor in the atmosphere has been increasing at a rate of about 1.5% per decade over the last 30 years as the planet warms. This is not surprising, since warmer air tends to "hold" more water vapor, but is a nice confirmation of estimates of temperature rise made by other instruments and methods.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
