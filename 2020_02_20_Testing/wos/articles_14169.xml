Many of the cloud microphysics models in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) assume a gamma distribution for cloud drops. In this paper, years of multicylinder data are reanalyzed to determine the best-fitting gamma or monodisperse distribution to compare with parameters in the WRF cloud models. The single-moment cloud schemes specify a predetermined and constant drop number density in clouds, which leads to a fixed relationship between the median volume drop diameter and the liquid water content. The Mount Washington drop number densities are generally larger and best-fit distributions are generally narrower than is typically assumed in WRF.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
