SAID occurs mostly at similar to 62 degrees/-60 degrees magnetic latitude (MLAT) and similar to 22:15/22:45 magnetic local time (MLT) for geomagnetically quiet conditions and at similar to 58 degrees/-56 degrees MLAT and similar to 22:15/22:45 MLT for geomagnetically disturbed conditions in the North Hemisphere (NH)/South Hemisphere (SH), respectively. Significant north-south asymmetries in SAID occurrence, shape, and geomagnetic activity variations are found in this statistical study. The latitudinal width of a SAID is larger in the NH than in the SH. An interesting finding of this work is that the SAID occurrence probability peaks have an similar to 180 degrees difference in longitude between the two hemispheres in the geographic coordinates for both geomagnetically quiet and disturbed conditions. The SAID width peaks in almost the same geomagnetic meridian zone with a geomagnetic longitude of similar to 80 degrees-120 degrees in both hemispheres. Significant hemispheric asymmetries and spike signatures with sharp dips are found in all the latitudinal profiles of the horizontal velocities of SAIDs. The SAID is highly correlated to geomagnetic activity, indicating that the location and evolution of the SAID might be influenced by global geomagnetic activity, auroral dynamics, and the dynamics of ring currents.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
