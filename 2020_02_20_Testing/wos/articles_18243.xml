We considered the most common case of a groove profile with rectangular apex. Our derivation correctly identifies the geometric parameters of a blazed reflective grating that determine its diffraction efficiency, and fixes an incorrect but commonly adopted expression in the literature. We compare the predictions of this scalar theory with those resulting from a rigorous vector treatment of diffraction from one-dimensional blazed reflective gratings.
