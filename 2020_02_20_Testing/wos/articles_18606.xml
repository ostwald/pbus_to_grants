It is found that positive PW trends predominate over the globe, with larger magnitudes over ocean than over land. The PW trend is correlated with surface warming spatially over ocean with a pattern correlation coefficient of 0.51. The PW percentage increase rate normalized by T-s expressed as d lnPW/dT(s) is larger and closer to the rate implied by the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) equation over ocean than over land. The 2-hourly GPS PW data show that the PW trend from 1995 to 2011 is larger at night than during daytime. Nighttime PW monthly anomalies correlate positively and significantly with nighttime minimum temperature T-min at all stations, but this is not true for daytime PW and maximum temperature T-max. The ratio of relative PW changes with T-min (dlnPW/dT(min)) is larger and closer to the C-C equation's implied value of similar to 7% K (1)than d lnPW/dT(max). This suggests that the relationship between PW and T-s at night is a better indicator of the water vapor feedback than that during daytime, when clouds and other factors also influence T-s.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
