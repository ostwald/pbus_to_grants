Given a model grid, the software computes the fraction of the grid box covered by land, the grid-box mean elevation (deviation from a geoid that defines nominal sea level surface), and associated sub-grid-scale variances commonly used for gravity wave and turbulent mountain stress parameterizations. The software supports regular latitude-longitude grids as well as unstructured grids, e.g., icosahedral, Voronoi, cubed-sphere and variable-resolution grids.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
