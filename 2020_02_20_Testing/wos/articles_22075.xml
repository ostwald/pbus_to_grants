Therefore, identifying and quantifying uncertainty in these land surface model (LSM) processes are essential for improving climate models. The specifications of land cover and soil texture types, intertwined with the uncertainties in associated vegetation and soil parameters in LSMs, are significant sources of uncertainty due to the lack of detailed land survey in the TP. To differentiate the effects of land cover or soil texture specifications in the Noah with Multiple Parameterizations (Noah-MP) LSM from the effects of uncertainties in the model parameters, this study first identified the most sensitive vegetation and soil parameters through global sensitivity analysis and then conducted parametric ensemble simulations using two land cover data sets and two soil texture data sets over the central TP to estimate their corresponding impacts on the overall model responses. The distinction level and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were then applied to assess the differences between the results from parametric ensemble simulations using different land cover or soil texture data sets. The results show that the simulated energy and water fluxes over the central TP are dominated by soil parameters. The canopy height is the most sensitive vegetation parameter, and the Clapp-Hornberger b parameter (the exponent in the function that relates soil water potential and water content) is the most sensitive soil parameter. Relative to the background parametric uncertainties, the Noah-MP LSM could not sufficiently distinguish the effects of changes between forested types or soil texture types, which highlight the need for further quantifying and reducing the parametric uncertainties in LSMs. Further analysis shows significant sensitivities of the distinction level and changes in model response to annual precipitation and vegetation fraction. This work provides a scientific reference for assessing the impacts of land cover or soil texture changes on Noah-MP simulations under future climate change conditions.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
