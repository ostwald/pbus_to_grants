During the noncontinuous, 11-day test period, in which the systems operated side by side, the micropulse lidar was operated at its maximum pulse repetition frequency (15 kHz) and integrated elastic backscatter over the interpulse period of the analog direct-detection lidar (0.1 s). Operation at the high pulse repetition frequency resulted in second-trip echoes that contaminated portions of the data. The performance of the micropulse lidar varied with background brightness-as expected with a photon-counting receiver-yet showed equal or larger backscatter intensity signal-to-noise ratio throughout the experiment. Examples of wind fields and time series of wind vectors from both systems during the Chico experiment are presented. In addition, scans over the ocean that were collected by the micropulse lidar during a subsequent deployment on the northern California coast are presented. We conclude by reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of each system and make some suggestions to improve the design and performance of future systems. (C) The Authors.
