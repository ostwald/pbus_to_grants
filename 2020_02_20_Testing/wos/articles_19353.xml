Product branching ratios for OH oxidation were found to be temperature dependent with the alpha, beta and gamma channels changing from 34 +/- 6 to 47 1%, from 58 6 to 37 9%, and from 8 1 to 16 4%, respectively, between 251 and 340 K. Recommended temperature-dependent site specific modified Arrhenius expressions for the OH reaction rate coefficient are (cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)): k(a)(T) = 8.64 x 10(-18) X T(1.91)exp(666/T); k(beta)(T) = 5.15 X 10(-19) x T(2.04)exp(1304/T); k(gamma)(T) = 3.20 X 10(-17) X T(1.78)exp(107/T); k(OH)(T) = 2.10 X 10-18 X T(2)exp(-23/T), where k(Total)(T) = k(alpha)(T) + k beta(T) + k(gamma)(T) + k(OH)(T). The expressions were constrained using the product branching ratios measured in this study and previous total phenomenological rate coefficient measurements. The site-specific expressions compare reasonably well with recent theoretical work. It is shown that use of i-butanol would result in acetone as the dominant degradation product under most atmospheric conditions.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
