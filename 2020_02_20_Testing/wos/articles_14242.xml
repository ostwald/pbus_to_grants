The schemes are Bougeault-LaCarrere (BouLac), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE), and Yonsei University (YSU) versions 3.2 and 3.4.1. This study's chosen objectively determined model NBL height h estimate uses a turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) threshold equal to 5% TKEmax', where TKE' is relative to its background (free atmosphere) value. The YSU-and MYJ-determined h could not be improved upon. Observed heights of the virtual temperature maximum h(Tvmax) and wind speed maximum h(Smax), and the heights h(1wsonde) and h(2wsonde), between which the radiosonde slows from similar to 5 to similar to 3 m s(-1) as it rises from turbulent to nonturbulent air, and thus brackets h, were used for comparison to model results. The observations revealed a general pattern: h(Tvmax) increased through the night, and h(Tvmax) and h(Smax) converged with time, and the two mostly lay between h(1wsonde) and h(2wsonde) after several hours. Clear failure to adhere to this pattern and large excursions from observations or other PBL schemes revealed excess mixing for BouLac and YSU version 3.2 (but not version 3.4.1) and excess thermal mixing for QNSE under windy conditions. Observed friction velocity u(*) was much smaller than model values, with differences consistent with the observations reflecting local skin drag and the model reflecting regional form drag + skin drag.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
