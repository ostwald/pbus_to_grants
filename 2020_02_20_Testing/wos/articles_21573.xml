Two distinct processes contribute to the observed warming signal: (i) local warming in direct response to the GHG forcing and (ii) the effect of enhanced poleward heat transport from low latitudes. A series of aquaplanet experiments, which excludes the surface albedo feedback, is conducted to quantify the relative contributions of these two physical processes to the polar warming magnitude and degree of amplification relative to the global mean. The globe is divided into zonal bands with equal area in eight experiments. For each of these, an external heating is prescribed beneath the slab ocean layer in the respective forcing bands. The summation of the individual temperature responses to each local heating in these experiments is very similar to the response to a globally uniform heating. This allows the authors to decompose the polar warming and amplification signal into the effects of local and remote heating. Local polar heating that induces surface-trapped warming due to the large tropospheric static stability in this region accounts for about half of the polar surface warming. Cloud radiative effects act to enhance this local contribution. In contrast, remote nonpolar heating induces a robust polar warming pattern that features a midtropospheric peak, regardless of the meridional location of the forcing. Among all remote forcing experiments, the deep tropical forcing case contributes most to the polar-amplified surface warming pattern relative to the global mean, while the high-latitude forcing cases contribute most to enhancing the polar surface warming magnitude.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
