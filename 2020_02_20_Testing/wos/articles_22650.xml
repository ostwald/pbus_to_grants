This study uses idealized Weather Research and Forecasting Model simulations to examine TC structure and convection affected by various LMFs directed toward eight shear-relative orientations. The simulated TC affected by an initially imposed LMF directed toward downshear left yields an anomalously high intensification rate, while an upshear-right LMF yields a relatively high expansion rate. These two shear-relative LMF orientations affect the asymmetry of both surface fluxes and frictional inflow in the boundary layer and thus modify the TC convection. During the early development stage, the initially imposed downshear-left LMF promotes inner-core convection because of high boundary layer moisture fluxes into the inner core and is thus favorable for TC intensification because of large radial fluxes of azimuthal mean vorticity near the radius of maximum wind in the boundary layer. However, TCs affected by various LMFs may modify the near-TC VWS differently, making the intensity evolution afterward more complicated. The TC with a fast-established eyewall in response to the downshear-left LMF further reduces the near-TC VWS, maintaining a relatively high intensification rate. For the upshear-right LMF that leads to active and sustained rainbands in the downshear quadrants, TC size expansion is promoted by a positive radial flux of eddy vorticity near the radius of 34-kt wind (1 kt approximate to 0.51 m s(-1)) because the vorticity associated with the rainbands is in phase with the storm-motion-relative inflow.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
