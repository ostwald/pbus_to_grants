Accurate and reliable wind power predictions are necessary to optimize the integration of wind power into existing electrical systems. In this study, a hybrid forecasting system of wind power generation was developed by integrating the Kalman filter (KF) with the high resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model as well as an empirical formula of wind power output (power curve). The system has been validated with observations including wind speed and power output over a six-month period for 15 turbine sites at a wind farm in Awaji-island, Japan. The results show that the tuned WRF model is able to provide hub-height wind speed prediction for the target area with reliability to some extent. The predicted wind field can be substantially improved by the Kalman filter as a post-processing procedure. The 15-turbine averaged improvements of mean error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient are 97%, 22%, and 10%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Kalman filter also demonstrates a promising capability of reducing the uncertainties in the power curve model. Systematic validations regarding both wind speed and power output were carried out against the observations for the target wind farm, which show that the hybrid power forecasting system presented in this paper can be an effective and practical tool for short-term predictions of wind speed and power output in Japan area.
