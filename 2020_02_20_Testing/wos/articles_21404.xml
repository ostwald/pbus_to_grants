To study such effects, risk maps are a common epidemiological tool that is used to identify regions and populations that are more susceptible to these negative outcomes; however, the negative health effects of high temperatures are manifested differently between different segments of the population. We propose a novel, hierarchical marked point process model that merges multiple health outcomes into an overall heat risk map. Specifically, we consider health outcomes of heat-stress-related emergency service calls and mortalities across the city of Houston, Texas. We show that combining multiple health outcomes leads to a broader understanding of the spatial distribution of heat risk than a single health outcome.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
