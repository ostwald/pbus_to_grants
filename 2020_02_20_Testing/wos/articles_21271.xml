These data-driven methods are taking on new importance in light of the shifting data landscape of the geospace system, which extends from the near Earth space environment, through the magnetosphere and interplanetary space, to the Sun. The space physics community faces both an exciting opportunity and an important imperative to create a new frontier built at the intersection of traditional approaches and state-of-the-art data-driven sciences and technologies. This brief commentary addresses the current paradigm of geospace science and the emerging need for data science innovation, discusses the meaning of data science in the context of geospace, and highlights community efforts to respond to the changing landscape.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
