Recent enhancements to the MOPITT retrieval algorithm have resulted in the release of the version 7 (V7) product. Improvements include (1) representation of growing atmospheric concentrations of N2O, (2) use of meteorological fields from the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) reanalysis for the entire MOPITT mission (instead of MERRA), (3) use of the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collection 6 cloud mask product (instead of Collection 5), (4) a new strategy for radiance-bias correction and (5) an improved method for calibrating MOPITT's near-infrared (NIR) radiances. Statistical comparisons of V7 validation results with corresponding V6 results are presented, using aircraft in situ measurements as the reference. Clear improvements are demonstrated for V7 products with respect to overall retrieval biases, bias variability and bias drift uncertainty.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
