This work was stimulated by solar observations of that doublet, which have proven particularly challenging to explain through available models of polarized line formation, even to the point of casting doubts on our very understanding of the underlying physics. The purpose of the experiment was to test a quantum theory for the polarized scattering of spectrally flat incident radiation, on which much of the current magnetic diagnostics of stellar atmospheres is based. The experiment has confirmed the predictions of that theory, and its adequacy for the modeling of scattering polarization under flat-spectrum illumination.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
