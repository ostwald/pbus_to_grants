While the cloud-climate coupling is strong, precipitation anomalies impact monthly climate for as long as 5 months. The April climate has memory of precipitation anomalies back to freeze-up in November, mostly stored in the snowpack. The summer climate has memory of precipitation anomalies back to the beginning of snowmelt in March. In the warm season, mean temperature is strongly correlated to opaque cloud anomalies, but only weakly to precipitation anomalies. Mixing ratio anomalies are correlated to precipitation, but only weakly to cloud. The diurnal cycle of mixing ratio shifts upward with increasing precipitation anomalies. Positive precipitation anomalies are coupled to a lower afternoon lifting condensation level and a higher afternoon equivalent potential temperature; both favor increased convection and precipitation. Regression coefficients on precipitation increase from wet to dry conditions. This is consistent with increased uptake of soil water when monthly precipitation is low, until drought conditions are reached, and also consistent with gravity satellite observations. Regression analysis shows monthly opaque cloud cover is tightly correlated to three climate variables that are routinely observed: diurnal temperature range, mean temperature, and mean relative humidity. The set of correlation coefficients, derived from cloud and climate observations, could be used to evaluate the representation of the land-cloud-atmosphere system in both forecast and climate models.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
