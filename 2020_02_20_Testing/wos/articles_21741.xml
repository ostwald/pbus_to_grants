Both the CMORPH and Du model data indicate that the diurnal cycle of rainfall has two propagation modes near the coast: onshore and offshore. The diurnally periodic winds (vertical motions) also show a similar propagation feature. Analysis of the rainfall budget indicates that vertically integrated vertical vapor advection plays a key role in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and thus provides a physical connection between winds and rainfall in the diurnal cycle. It was found that a simple 2D linear land-sea breeze model with a background wind can well capture the two propagation modes, which are associated with inertia-gravity waves, in terms of speed and phase. The background wind changes the pattern of the inertia-gravity waves and further affects the diurnal propagation. The effect of the background wind on the diurnal propagation was verified through idealized simulations using a simplified version of the WRF Model that can also capture the diurnal features.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
