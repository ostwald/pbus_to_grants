These disturbances frequently pass over the Intermountain West region of the United States during the early morning hours preceding severe weather events. This region has fewer in situ observations of the atmospheric state compared with most other areas of the United States, contributing toward greater uncertainty in forecast initial conditions. Assimilation of supplemental observations is hypothesized to reduce initial condition uncertainty and improve forecasts of high-impact weather.</p><p>During the spring of 2013, the Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX) leveraged ensemble-based targeting methods to key in on regions where enhanced observations might reduce mesoscale forecast uncertainty. Observations were obtained with dropsondes released from the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream-V aircraft during the early morning hours preceding 15 severe weather events over areas upstream from anticipated convection. Retrospective data-denial experiments are conducted to evaluate the value of dropsonde observations in improving convection-permitting ensemble forecasts. Results show considerable variation in forecast performance from assimilating dropsonde observations, with a modest but statistically significant improvement, akin to prior targeted observation studies that focused on synoptic-scale prediction. The change in forecast skill with dropsonde information was not sensitive to the skill of the control forecast. Events with large positive impact sampled both the disturbance and adjacent flow, akin to results from past synoptic-scale targeting studies, suggesting that sampling both the disturbance and adjacent flow is necessary regardless of the horizontal scale of the feature of interest.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
