We address the achievable objectives and the challenges of present measurement techniques and interpretation tools. In particular, we focus on the role that these observations can play for constraining and validating numerical models of the global coronal magnetic field. With regard to optical techniques, we mainly focus on the use of M1 diagnostics, further developing the theory of the formation of their polarization signatures in the magnetized corona.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
