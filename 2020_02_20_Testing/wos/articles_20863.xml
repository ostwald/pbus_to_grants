This study combines in-situ BC measurements in the Himalayas and the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) with a regional dynamical and chemical model (WRF-Chem model) to investigate the effect of the trans-Himalayas on black carbon (BC) from the IGP to the TP during Indian summer monsoon. To determine topographic effects of the trans-Himalayas on BC concentrations over the TP, sensitive experiments were conducted by applying the WRF-Chem model. The results showed that the reduction of the altitude of the Himalayas had an important effect on the trans-Himalayas transport of BC. There was an obvious increase in BC concentration over the trans-Himalayas region, but no significant increase over the TP because the TP (a.m.s.l similar to 4 km) always acted as a wall to prevent BC transport from the IGP to the TP. The trans-Himalayas transport of BC was strongly dependent upon meteorological conditions over the IGP. During summer monsoon, there were three types of cyclones at different locations and one kind of convergent circulation in the IGP. Under the condition of convergent airflows, a strong northeastward wind produced the trans-Himalayas transport of BC. As a result, BC concentrations in the southeastern TP significantly increased to 0.6-0.8 mu g m(-3). When the cyclone located in the eastern IGP, high BC concentrations over the IGP were transported along the foothill of the Himalayas, resulting in a significant reduction of the trans-Himalayas transport. When the cyclone moved to the west, the dynamical perturbations for the trans-Himalayas transport were weaker than the eastern cyclone, and the trans-Himalayas transport were enhanced in the middle and eastern Himalayas. This study will be helpful to assess the impacts of BC particles emitted from South Asia on regional climate change and ecological environment over the TP in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
