Some of these observations were made around the time of large ionospheric drifts within a subauroral polarization stream (SAPS). During the storm main phase, we identify multiple disturbance characteristics in the North American late afternoon and dusk sector. (1) Strong subauroral westward drifts occurred between 20 and 24UT near MHO, accompanied by a storm enhanced density plume passage over MHO in the afternoon with a poleward/upward ion drift. The strongly westward flow reached 2000m/s speed near the poleward plume edge. (2) Prompt penetration electric field signatures, appearing as poleward/upward ion drifts on the dayside over both MHO and AO, were consistent with DMSP vertical drift data and contributed to plume development. (3) Meridional wind equatorward surges occurred during daytime hours at MHO, followed by 2-3h period oscillations at both MHO and AO. The zonal electric field at AO was strongly correlated with the wind oscillation. (4) Large ion temperature enhancements as well as 50+m/s upward ion drifts throughout the E and F regions were observed during the SAPS period. These were presumably caused by strong frictional heating due to large plasma drifts. The heating effects appeared to drive significant atmospheric upwelling, and corresponding ion upflow was also observed briefly. This study highlights some of the important effects of fast plasma transport as well as other disturbance dynamics on ion-neutral coupling during a single intensification period within a great geomagnetic storm.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
