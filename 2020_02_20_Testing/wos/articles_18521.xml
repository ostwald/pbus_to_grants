To provide a first estimate of the aerosol radiative impacts from domestic-waste combustion, we incorporate the Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) emissions inventory into GEOS-Chem-TOMAS, a global chemical-transport model with online aerosol microphysics. We find domestic-waste combustion increases global-mean black carbon and organic aerosol concentrations by 8 and 6aEuro-%, respectively, and by greater than 40aEuro-% in some regions. Due to uncertainties regarding aerosol optical properties, we estimate the globally averaged aerosol direct radiative effect to range from -5 to -20aEuro-mWaEuro-m(-2); however, this range increases from -40 to +4aEuro-mWaEuro-m(-2) when we consider uncertainties in emission mass and size distribution. In some regions with significant waste combustion, such as India and China, the aerosol direct radiative effect may exceed -0.4aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2). Similarly, we estimate a cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect of -13aEuro-mWaEuro-m(-2), with a range of -4 to -49aEuro-mWaEuro-m(-2) due to emission uncertainties. In the regions with significant waste combustion, the cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect may exceed -0.4aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2).</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
