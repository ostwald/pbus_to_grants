The kinetic temperatures and CO2 volume mixing ratios (VMRs) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have been simultaneously retrieved using SABER limb radiances at 15 and 4.3 mu m under nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions. This paper presents results of a validation study of the SABER CO2 VMRs obtained with a two-channel, self-consistent temperature/CO2 retrieval algorithm. Results are based on comparisons with coincident CO2 measurements made by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and simulations using the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). The SABER CO2 VMRs are in agreement with ACE-FTS observations within reported systematic uncertainties from 65 to 110 km. The annual average SABER CO2 VMR falls off from a well-mixed value above similar to 80 km. Latitudinal and seasonal variations of CO2 VMRs are substantial. SABER observations and the SD-WACCM simulations are in overall agreement for CO2 seasonal variations, as well as global distributions in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Not surprisingly, the CO2 seasonal variation is shown to be driven by the general circulation, converging in the summer polar mesopause region and diverging in the winter polar mesopause region.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
