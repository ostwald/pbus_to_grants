Among the nine nodes generated to explain the variability of Antarctic sea ice cover, two (nodes 3 and 7) exhibit a statistically significant linear trend in the time series of the frequency of the SOM pattern occurrence that together explain 40% of the total trend in the sea ice cover. These two nodes have completely opposite spatial patterns and directions of trend and are associated with different atmospheric circulation patterns. Node 3, which represents an increase in sea ice over the Weddell Sea and the eastern Ross Sea and a decrease over the other coastal seas of West Antarctica, appears to be related to the positive phase of the southern annular mode (SAM) linked with the La Nina pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical Pacific Ocean. The opposite spatial pattern and trend represented by node 7 is associated with a wave train originating over northern Australia. The anomalous wind field, surface downward longwave radiation, and surface air temperature generated by these circulation patterns are consistent with the spatial pattern and overall trends in the Antarctic sea ice cover.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
