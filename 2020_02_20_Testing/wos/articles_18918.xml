Attempts to reconstruct temperatures in the seaway using the oxygen isotopic composition of biogenic carbonates have suffered from uncertainty in the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater (delta O-18(w)) in the semi-restricted basin. We present new reconstructed temperature and delta O-18(w) data from marine and estuarine environments in the WIS and freshwater environments in WIS source rivers, derived from clumped isotope analyses of bivalve and gastropod shells. We find temperatures of 5-21 degrees C, delta O-18(w) values below contemporaneous Gulf of Mexico marine sites, and a strong correlation between delta O-18(w) and environmental setting. We propose that decreasing delta O-18(w) values reflect decreasing salinity driven by an increasing contribution of continental runoff. Using a two-end-member salinity-delta O-18(w) mixing model, we estimate salinities of 29-35 psu (practical salinity units) for the deep marine, 20-32 psu for the shallow marine, and 11-26 psu for the estuarine environments of the WIS. New climate model simulations agree with reconstructed temperatures and salinities and suggest the presence of salinity driven stratification within the seaway.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
