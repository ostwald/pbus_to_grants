Program participants from four states were assigned either to the fully facilitated model or to the team study approach. Case studies were prepared for four participants from the Louisiana site, two from the fully facilitated NanoTeach model group and two from the team study NanoTeach group. Data for the case studies included in this article include qualitative and quantitative data regarding the changes in teachers' NS&amp;T knowledge and their ability to teach the content using the effective strategies included in the professional development sessions and resource materials. The case studies provide new insights into the ways teachers' integrated NS&amp;T in the high school curriculum.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
