This radar has some similar and some distinguishing characteristics to the National Weather Service (NWS) operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler Polarimetric (WSR-88DP). One key difference is that the WSR-88DP is used for operational purposes where rapid 360 degrees volumetric scanning is required to monitor rapid changes in storm characteristics for nowcasting and issuing severe storm warnings. Since S-Pol is used to support the NSF research community, it usually scans at much slower rates than operational radars. This results in higher resolution and higher data quality suitable for many research studies. An important difference between S-Pol and the WSR-88DP is S-Pol's ability to use customized scan strategies including scanning on vertical surfaces ([range-height indicators (RHIs)], which are presently not done by WSR-88DPs. RHIs provide high-resolution microphysical structures of convective storms, which are central to many research studies. Another important difference is that the WSR-88DP simultaneously transmits horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarized pulses. In contrast, S-Pol typically transmits alternating H and V pulses, which results in not only higher data quality for research but also allows for the cross-polar signal to be measured. The cross-polar signal provides estimates of the linear depolarization ratio (LDR) and the co- to cross-correlation coefficient that give additional microphysical information. This paper presents plots and interpretations of high-quality, high-resolution polarimetric data that demonstrate the value of S-Pol's polarimetric measurements for atmospheric research.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
