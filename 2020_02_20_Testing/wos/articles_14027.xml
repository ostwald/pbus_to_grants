Lower tropospheric ozone shows a prominent seasonality with highest levels during spring (similar to 70-110 ppbv in May) and lowest levels during summer-monsoon (similar to 20-50 ppbv), which is consistent with the ground-based observations. The lower tropospheric ozone minimum coincides with highest values of relative humidity (80-100%) during the summer-monsoon. However, ozone mixing ratios in the middle-upper troposphere show less pronounced and different seasonality. Influences of subtropical jets are observed (wind speed: similar to 40-80 m s(-1)) in the middleupper troposphere, particularly during winter. A stratospheric intrusion event during winter is observed, which enhances the ozone levels by similar to 180% in the middle-upper troposphere. A noticeable feature of secondary ozone peaks (similar to 140-250 ppbv) is observed in the middle troposphere (similar to 8-12 km), more frequently during spring. Ozone levels in 2-4 km altitude range are higher by 19.9 +/- 4.6 ppbv during the springtime high fire activity period over the northern India Moreover, the lower tropospheric ozone levels over Nainital during spring are found to be considerably (similar to 30 ppbv) higher than those over Ahmedabad in the western India. This ozone enhancement is attributed mainly to the regional pollution of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) supplemented with the northern Indian biomass burning. It is suggested that regional photochemistry and biomass burning processes play controlling role in the lower troposphere, while, the middle-upper tropospheric variations are driven by dynamical processes including advection and stratospheric intrusion.
