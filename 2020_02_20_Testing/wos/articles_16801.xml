Passengers and crew were able to evacuate quickly, and, although there were injuries, there were no fatalities. Winds around the time of the accident were predominantly from the west, with substantial spatial and temporal speed variability across the airport property. Embedded in this mostly westerly flow were intermittent gusts that created strong crosswinds for the north-south runways. According to the report from the National Transportation Safety Board, it was one of these strong gusts that initiated the events that led to the runway excursion and subsequent crash of the aircraft. Numerous aircraft reported significant mountain-wave activity and turbulence over Colorado on the day of the accident. To determine whether wave activity may have contributed to the strong, intermittent gustiness at DIA, a high-resolution multinested numerical simulation was performed using the Clark-Hall model, with a horizontal grid spacing of 250 m in the inner domain. Results from this simulation suggest that the surface gustiness at DIA was associated with undulations in a train of lee waves in a midtropospheric stable layer above the airport, creating regions of higher-velocity air descending toward the surface. In contrast, a simulation with horizontal grid spacing that was similar to that of a state-of-the-art operational forecast model (3 km) did not predict strong winds at DIA.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
