The authors provide closed budgets based on output from a high-resolution numerical simulation and partial budgets based on analyses of observational climatologies of hydrography and surface fluxes. With this choice of control volume, advection is eliminated from the instantaneous volume-integrated salt budget, and time-mean advection is eliminated from the budget evaluated from time-averaged data. In this way, the role of irreversible mixing processes in the maintenance and variability of the salinity maximum are more readily revealed. By carrying out the analysis with both near-instantaneous and time-averaged model output, the role of mesoscale eddies in stirring and mixing for this water mass is determined. This study finds that the small-scale mixing acting on enhanced gradients generated by the mesoscale eddies is approximately equal to that acting on the large-scale gradients estimated from climatological-mean conditions. The isohaline salinity budget can be related to water mass transformation rates associated with surface forcing and mixing processes in a straightforward manner. The authors find that the surface net evaporation in the North Atlantic salinity maximum region accounts for a transformation of 7 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) of water across the 37-psu isohaline outcrop into the salinity maximum in the simulation, whereas the estimate based on climatological observations is 9 to 10 Sv.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
