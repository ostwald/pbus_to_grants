CAWFE simulated the meteorological flow in and near the fire, the fire's growth as influenced by gusty Santa Ana winds and interactions between the fire and weather through fire-induced winds during the first day of burning. The airflow was characterised by thermally stratified, two-layer flow channelled between the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountain ranges with transient flow accelerations driving the fire in Cabazon Peak's lee. The simulation reproduced distinguishing features of the fire including its overall direction and width, rapid spread west-south-westward across canyons, spread up canyons crossing its southern flank, splitting into two heading regions and feathering of the fire line. The simulation correctly depicted the fire's location at the time of an early-morning incident involving firefighter fatalities. It also depicted periods of deep plume growth, but anomalously described downhill spread of the head of the fire under weak winds that was less rapid than observed. Although capturing the meteorological flow was essential to reproducing the fire's evolution, fuel factors including fuel load appeared to play a secondary role.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
