A multi-cusp magnetic bucket constructed from strong samarium cobalt permanent magnets now confines a 10 m(3), fully ionized, magnetic-field-free plasma in a spherical geometry. Plasma parameters of T-e approximate to 5 to 20 eV and n(e) approximate to 10(11) to 5 x 10(12) cm(-3) provide an ideal testbed for a range of astrophysical experiments, including self-exciting dynamos, collisionless magnetic reconnection, jet stability, stellar winds and more. This article describes the capabilities of WiPAL, along with several experiments, in both operating and planning stages, that illustrate the range of possibilities for future users.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
