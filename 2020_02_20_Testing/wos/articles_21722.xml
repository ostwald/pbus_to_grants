Both SABER and SOFIE observations revealed that both temperature increase (having peaks of similar to 15-25 K) and decrease (having peak of similar to 15 K), which were associated with the storm, occurred in the two hemispheres. The magnitudes of temperature variations changed with latitude, altitude, and the phase of the storm. The peaks of the temperature increase occurred 0.5-1.5 days later than the peak of the AE index, depending on latitude and height. Global circulation changes initiated due to heating and ion drag in the auroral region are likely responsible for the temperature increases or decreases in the lower thermosphere.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
