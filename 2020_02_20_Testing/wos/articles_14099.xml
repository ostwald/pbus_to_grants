The current study has two aims: first, to provide an estimate of surface enthalpy fluxes obtained from dropsonde data and second, to provide evidence of spray-mediated enthalpy transfer. These are accomplished first by assuming that Monin-Obukhov similarity is satisfied throughout the bottom 100m of the high-wind boundary layer, then by focusing on the enthalpy flux H-K rather than its transfer coefficient C-K. The scaling of H(K)with wind speed in observational data sets reveals similarities to spray-mediated fluxes predicted by a newly developed surface flux model, in contrast with measurements made in a laboratory setting. This behavior supports the claim that surface enthalpy fluxes are dominated by spray within tropical cyclones.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>&lt;list list-type="bulleted"&gt; &lt;list-item id="grl51609-li-0001"&gt;Spray dominates enthalpy flux at the hurricane air-sea interface &lt;list-item id="grl51609-li-0002"&gt;Enthalpy fluxes can be estimated from dropsonde thermodynamic data &lt;list-item id="grl51609-li-0003"&gt;Trends of enthalpy flux coefficient can be misleading due to uncertainty</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
