Observations by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F12 to F15 satellites indicate that the SAPS were first generated around the dusk sector at the beginning of the main phase. The SAPS channel then expanded toward the midnight sector and moved to lower latitudes as the main phase progressed. The peak velocity, latitudinal width, latitudinal alignment, and longitudinal span of the SAPS channel were highly dynamic during the storm main phase. The large westward velocities of the SAPS were located in the region of low electron densities, associated with low ionospheric conductivity. The large-scale structures of the SAPS also corresponded closely to those of the region-2 field-aligned currents, which were mainly determined by the azimuthal pressure gradient of the ring current.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
