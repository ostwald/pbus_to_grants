The simulations use three spatial resolutions, three anthropogenic emission inventories, two meteorological fields, and nine emission scenarios. These simulations are evaluated against measurements from the DC-8 aircraft and Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT). Results show that simulations using bottom-up emissions are consistently lower (bias: -34 to -39%) and poorer performing (Taylor skill: 0.38-0.61) than simulations using alternative anthropogenic emissions (bias: -6 to -33%; Taylor skill: 0.48-0.86), particularly for enhanced Asian CO and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission scenarios, suggesting underestimation in modeled CO background and emissions in the region. The ranges of source contributions to modeled CO along DC-8 aircraft from Korea and southern (90 degrees E to 123 degrees E, 20 degrees N to 29 degrees N), middle (90 degrees E to 123 degrees E, 29 degrees N to 38.5 degrees N), and northern (90 degrees E to 131.5 degrees E, 38.5 degrees N to 45 degrees N) East Asia (EA) are 6-13%, similar to 5%, 16-28%, and 9-18%, respectively. CO emissions from middle and northern EA can reach Korea via transport within the boundary layer, whereas those from southern EA are transported to Korea mainly through the free troposphere. Emission contributions from middle EA dominate during continental outflow events (29-51%), while Korean emissions play an overall more important role for ground sites (up to 25-49%) and plumes within the boundary layer (up to 25-44%) in Korea. Finally, comparisons with four other source contribution approaches (FLEXPART 9.1 back trajectory calculations driven by Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) WRF inert tracer, China signature VOCs, and CO to CO2 enhancement ratios) show general consistency with CAM-chem.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
