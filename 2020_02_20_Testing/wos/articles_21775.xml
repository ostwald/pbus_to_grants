NOF (W/m(2)) from 100-to 250-km altitude is extracted from 13.7 years of data from the TIMED satellite, Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument, and decomposed into four empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and their amplitudes. We determine the strongest modes of NOF variability in the data set and develop a compact model of NOF. The first four EOFs account for 83% of the variability in the data. We illustrate the NOF model and discuss the geophysical associations of the EOFs. The first EOF represents 69% of the total variance and correlates strongly with Kp and solar shortwave flux, suggesting that geomagnetic activity and solar weather account for a large portion of NOF variability. EOF 2 shows annual and seasonal variations, possibly due to annual and seasonal thermospheric composition and temperature changes and may represent the chemical breathing mode of NOF. EOF 3 shows annual variations and correlates with solar energetic particle events and X-flares. EOF 3 may represent winter time solar energetic particle event-enhanced diurnal tide effects. EOF 4 suggests a meridional transport mechanism at the predawn and postdusk equator after strong storms. The EOF uncertainty is verified using cross-validation analysis. Quantifying the spatial and temporal variabilities of NOF using eigenmodes will increase the understanding of how upper atmospheric nitric oxide cooling behaves and could increase the accuracy of future space weather and climate models.</p><p>Plain Language Summary Nitric oxide (NO) is a trace constituent of Earth's upper atmosphere that exhibits strong solar-geospace coupling. Although NO accounts for a small percentage of the thermosphere's composition, it is one of the most significant constituents in cooling the thermosphere via infrared radiation above 120 km, especially during storm time. We used similar to 14 years of data observed by the TIMED low Earth orbiting satellite to determine global, average patterns of NO flux, and the primary modes of variability in these patterns. The first mode of variability represents 69% of the total variance and correlates strongly geomagnetic activity and solar emissions. The second mode shows annual and seasonal variations. The third mode of variability shows annual variations and correlates with solar energetic particle events and X-class flares. The fourth mode of variability suggests a meridional transport mechanism after strong storms. We provide maps of the average and variability patterns in geomagnetic latitude and solar local time coordinates. Quantifying the spatial and temporal variabilities of NO infrared flux in the thermosphere will increase the understanding of how upper atmospheric NO cooling behaves and could be used to increase the accuracy of future space weather and climate models.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
