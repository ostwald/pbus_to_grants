This uncertainty underscores the need to develop a framework to more thoroughly evaluate model parameterizations, structures, and projections. Toward this end we used an analytical solution to calculate approximate equilibrium soil C pools for the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4cn) and Daily Century (DAYCENT) soil biogeochemistry models. Neither model generated sufficient soil C pools when forced with litterfall inputs from CLM4cn; however, global totals and spatial correlations of soil C pools for both models improved when calculated with litterfall inputs derived from observational data. DAYCENT required additional modifications to simulate soil C pools in deeper soils (0-100cm). Our best simulations produced global soil C pools totaling 746 and 978 Pg C for CLM4cn and DAYCENT parameterizations, respectively, compared to observational estimates of 1259 Pg C. In spite of their differences in complexity and equilibrium soil C pools, predictions of soil C losses with warming temperatures through 2100 were strikingly similar for both models. Ultimately, CLM4cn and DAYCENT come from the same class of models that represent the turnover of soil C as a first-order decay process. While this approach may have utility in calculating steady state soil C pools, the applicability of this model configuration in transient simulations remains poorly evaluated.</p><p>Key Points</p><p>&lt;list list-type="bulleted" id="gbc20130-list-0001"&gt; &lt;list-item id="gbc20130-li-0001"&gt;SOC estimates from ESMs show wide variation and are exceptionally low in CLM4cn &lt;list-item id="gbc20130-li-0002"&gt;After modifications DAYCENT parameterizations provide more realistic SOC pools &lt;list-item id="gbc20130-li-0003"&gt;SOC responses to warming suggest further evaluation of models are warranted</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
