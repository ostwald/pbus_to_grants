He received a bachelor's degree in earth and planetary sciences from Harvard in 1993 and a PhD in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1999. Before joining NCAR in 2002, he completed a post-doctoral fellowship with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases group. His research has focused on developing and deploying new instruments for tower, ship, and aircraft-based observations of atmospheric O-2 and CO2, and on synthesizing data sets and models to elucidate global carbon cycle processes.</p><p>He maintains a network of CO, instruments in the US Rocky Mountains and an O-2 instrument on a ship in the Southern Ocean. His research contributions include a synthesis of airborne data that led to a major revision of model-based estimates of the global distribution of terrestrial CO2 fluxes.</p><p>Britton Stephens speaks to Ruth Williamson, Commissioning Editor for Carbon Management, about promising state-of-the-art instruments for measuring atmospheric carbon cycle species, the challenges of conducting research on land, oceans and in the air, and important future directions for carbon cycle research.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
