The great low-latitude auroral displays seen throughout East Asia on 1770 September 16-18 are considered to manifest one of the greatest storms. Recently found, 111 historical documents in East Asia attest that these low-latitude auroral displays appeared in succession for almost nine nights during 1770 September 10-19 in low magnetic latitude areas (&lt;30 degrees). This suggests that the duration of the great magnetic storm is much longer than usual. Sunspot drawings from 1770 reveal that the sunspot areas were twice as large as those observed in another great storm of 1859, which substantiates these unusual storm activities in 1770. These spots likely ejected several huge, sequential magnetic structures in short duration into interplanetary space, resulting in spectacular worldwide aurorae in mid-September of 1770. These findings provide new insight into the history, duration, and effects of extreme magnetic storms that may be valuable for those who need to mitigate against extreme events.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
