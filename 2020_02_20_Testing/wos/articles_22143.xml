The particles were observed at low relative humidities and contain no detectable ice mass. We conclude that these particles are silicate ash injected by the Mount Kelud volcanic eruption in Indonesia a few weeks prior to the Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment flights. The Kelud ash particles were detected by cloud probes on the Global Hawk between the lapse rate tropopause (16.5 km) and the aircraft ceiling (18.5 km). The ash particles sampled in the lowermost stratosphere by the aircraft extended further north than the Kelud plume measured by spaceborne lidar at higher altitudes. The concentration of ash particles dropped off rapidly below the lapse rate tropopause, presumably because of rapid removal by ice nucleation on the ash particles followed by ice crystal sedimentation. Although ash particles are very effective ice nuclei, the low particle concentrations detected in the upper troposphere preclude a significant impact on cirrus microphysical properties.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
