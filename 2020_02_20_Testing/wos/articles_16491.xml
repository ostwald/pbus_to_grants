The present study indicates that the VM is closely linked to the development of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The VM may effectively act as an ocean bridge (or conduit) through which the extratropical atmospheric variability in the North Pacific influences ENSO. The VM can trigger the onset of ENSO via the following two dominant processes: (1) surface air-sea coupling associated with the VM in the subtropical/tropical Pacific and (2) evolution of subsurface ocean temperature anomalies along the equator associated with the VM. These two processes may force sufficient surface warming to occur in the central eastern equatorial Pacific from spring to summer, which in turn initiates an ENSO event. The VM influence on ENSO relies on a basin-scale air-sea interaction dynamic, as opposed to more local-scale dynamics typically associated with the seasonal footprinting mechanism or Pacific meridional mode. The majority of VM events are followed by ENSO events. These ENSO events triggered by VM include El Nino Modoki (EM) as well as conventional El Nino. There is no evidence that the VM tends to be more conducive to the initialization of EM than conventional El Nino.</p><p>Key Points</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
