Temperature variables are modeled in vector autoregressive framework, conditional on precipitation occurrence. Precipitation occurrence arises via a probit model, and both temperature and occurrence are spatially correlated using spatial Gaussian processes. Additionally, local climate is included by spatially varying model coefficients, allowing spatially evolving relationships between variables. The method is illustrated on a network of stations in the Pampas region of Argentina where nonstationary relationships and historical spatial correlation challenge existing approaches.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
