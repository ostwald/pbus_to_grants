The NCAR thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model reproduces the prevailing vertical drift feature and is used to examine possible causes. The simulations indicate that the modulation of the vertical drift is generated by the beating of the semidiurnal solar SW2 and lunar M-2 tides. During the SSW period the beating is observable since the magnitudes of lunar and solar semidiurnal tidal amplitudes are comparable. The theoretical beating frequency between SW2 and M-2 is 1/(15.13day) which may be modified due to phase changes. This study highlights the importance of the lunar tide during SSW periods and indicates that the equatorial vertical drift modulation should be observable at other longitudes as well.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
