The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Japanese Himawari-8/-9 provides high temporal and spatial resolution moisture information useful for weather monitoring and forecasting. Algorithms have been developed for three-layered precipitable water (LPW: surface to 0.9, 0.9-0.7, and 0.7-0.3 in sigma vertical coordinate) retrievals from AHI infrared band radiances using a Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series algorithm working group algorithm. The LPW products from AHI have been validated with in situ measurements. An important application of the AHI LPW product is to improve local severe storm forecasts through assimilating high temporal and spatial resolution moisture information into regional- and storm-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Assimilation techniques and approaches have been developed; the impact on precipitation forecasts for local severe storm over land from the assimilation of LPWs from AHI shows improvement on heavy precipitation forecasts over those from the assimilation of conventional data. Comparisons between AHI infrared band radiance assimilation and LPW assimilation show overall similar or comparable impact on precipitation forecast. The approaches for assimilating LPW can be applied to the assimilation of data from other advanced imagers such as the Advanced Baseline Imager onboard the U.S. next generation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R series, the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager onboard the Chinese FengYun-4 series, and the Flexible Combined Imager onboard the upcoming European Meteosat Third Generation.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
