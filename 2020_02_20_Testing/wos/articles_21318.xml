The standardized precipitation index on a time scale of 12months was used and compared with time series of other atmospheric conditions to identify major dry episodes from 1970 to 2012. The time series were derived from the second mode of a varimax-rotated empirical orthogonal functional analysis from the mean summer rainfall series observed at weather stations located in the Mexican Altiplano from 1970 through 2000. The results showed that the longest and most persistent episode occurred from 1998 through 2001, while the most severe dry episode occurred in 2011-2012, when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation was in a negative phase and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in a positive phase, both in combination with a La Nina event. A large upper-level anticyclone over the north-central United States is related to droughts in the Altiplano. Under these conditions, the droughts were linked to a large anticyclone positioned over the central-north of the United States, with consequent negative anomalies of specific humidity over central-northern Mexico. Concurrent with droughts in the interior of Mexico, are positive rainfall anomalies along the central Pacific coast of Mexico near the study area. Under different atmospheric conditions, opposite anomalous behaviour between the coast and interior can exist. The mechanism driving this see-saw behaviour between the west coast of Mexico and the Altiplano is explored.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
