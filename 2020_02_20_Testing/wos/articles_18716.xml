It is identified here that all historical OVs occurred during the convection-enhanced phase of the first northward-propagating intra-seasonal oscillation (FNISO). The individual contributions from the four large scale environmental fields associated with the intra-seasonal variations to the cyclone genesis are diagnosed with the aid of the genesis potential index. The significant moistening of mid-level atmosphere, which is embedded in the FNISO convection-enhanced phase, is shown to be the primary factor leading to the cyclone genesis. The water vapor budget analysis is further done to understand the governing process for the mid-level humidity increase. It is clearly seen that the vertical advection process, dominated by the anomalous vertical advection of the mean vertical water vapor gradient, plays the critical role. Hence the OVs are shown to be strongly modulated by FNISOs, both of which are important elements of the complex story of the BoB monsoon onset.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
