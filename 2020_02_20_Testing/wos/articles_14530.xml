This study presents results of new particle formation (NPF) and the growth of new particles to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-active sizes (similar to 100 nm) observed during this field campaign. The measured sub-5 nm particles were up to similar to 20,000 cm(-3) during a typical NPF event. Nucleation rates J(1) were relatively high (11.0 +/- 10.6 cm(-3) s(-1)), and one order of magnitude higher than formation rates of 5 nm particles (J(5)). Sub-5 nm particle formation events were observed during 64% of measurement days, with a high preference in biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)- and SO2-poor northwesterly (90%) air masses than in BVOCs-rich southerly air masses (13%). About 80% of sub-5 nm particle events led to the further growth. While high temperatures and high aerosol loadings in the southerly air masses were not favorable for nucleation, high BVOCs in the southerly air masses facilitated the growth of new particles to CCN-active sizes. In overall, 0.4-9.4% of the sub-5 nm particles grew to CCN-active sizes within each single NPF event. During a regional NPF event period that took place consecutively over several days, concentrations of CCN size particles increased by a factor of 4.7 in average. This enhanced production of CCN particles from new particles was commonly observed during all 13 regional NPF events during the campaign period.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
