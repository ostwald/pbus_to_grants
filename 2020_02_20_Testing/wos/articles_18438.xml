Results suggest that the waning continental ice sheet weakened atmospheric pressure centers in the region leading to a progression from a more sinuous to more zonal Pacific winter storm track throughout the deglaciation. Furthermore, variations in meltwater flux to the Atlantic influenced the meridional temperature gradient over the Pacific and thereby modulated storm track intensity. Changing sinuosity of the storm track may be reflected in broad increases in modeled delta O-18(precip) and observed delta O-18(speleothem) values from the western U.S. over the last deglaciation, whereas abrupt delta O-18(speleothem) shifts are dynamically consistent with the response of storm track intensity to variations in meltwater flux to the Atlantic.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
