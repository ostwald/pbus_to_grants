Profiles of Mg II, C II, and Si IV lines were obtained using IRIS before, during, and after the X2.1 flare of 2015 March 11 (SOL2015-03-11T16: 22). We analyze the profiles of the five transitions of Mg II (the 3p-3sh and k transitions, and three lines belonging to the 3d-3ptransitions). We use analytical methods to understand the unusual profiles, together with higher-resolution observational data of similar phenomena observed by Jing et al. The peculiar line ratios indicate anisotropic emission from the strands that have cross-strand line center optical depths (k line) of between 1 and 10. The lines are broadened by unresolved Alfvenic motions whose energy exceeds the radiation losses in the Mg II lines by an order of magnitude. The decay of the line widths is accompanied by a decay in the brightness, suggesting a causal connection. If the plasma is less than or similar to 99% ionized, ion-neutral collisions can account for the dissipation; otherwise, a dynamical process seems necessary. Our work implies that the motions are initiated during the impulsive phase, to be dissipated as radiation over a period of an hour, predominantly by strong chromospheric lines. The coronal "rain" we observe is far more turbulent than most earlier reports have indicated, with implications for plasma heating mechanisms.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
