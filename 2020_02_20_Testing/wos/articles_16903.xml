The results indicate for the first time that there is a double-layer structure in the distributions of 12year averaged OH airglow emission, [O-3], and [H] during the daytime. The upper layer of OH dayglow is located in the mesopause region (similar to 88km) at a similar altitude to that of the OH nightglow. The lower layer is situated in the range of 70-85km. Both the peak emission and height of the lower layer increase with local time. The distance between the two layers decreases with local time. At the equator, the lower layer forms at similar to 09:00 LT and lasts for about 8h; during this time the interlayer distance decreases from 13km to 5km. The double-layer structure is more obvious and longer-lived during the equinoxes and at lower latitudes. The double-layer structure of OH dayglow emission is a long-term stable structure and is mainly caused by photochemical processes involving [O-3]. It is also modulated by background atmospheric temperature and [H].</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
