To encourage the development of user-oriented verification approaches and support the major projects of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) World Weather Research Program, a challenge was issued to develop and demonstrate new user-oriented forecast verification metrics. Several new forecast verification metrics were proposed to meet the needs of very different user-communities including public safety and amenity, shipping, aviation, defence, agriculture, and water resources. A few general purpose metrics were also proposed. The winner of the inaugural verification challenge proposed a new metric called the Spatial Probability Score for assessing forecasts for the location of a relevant boundary or contour, for example, sea ice edge or extent of flood inundation. We hope and expect that many of the user-oriented forecast verification metrics submitted to the inaugural verification challenge will be taken up by the broader community.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
