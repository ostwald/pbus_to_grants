It was found that the long-lived UB together with the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO(+)) significantly contributes to the amplification of the WACE pattern. The present study examines how the UB variability affects quasi-biweekly WACE (QB-WACE) anomalies and depends on the NAO(+) and North Atlantic conditions by classifying the UB based on a case study of a cold event that occurred over southern China in January 2008. A composite analysis during 1979-2013 shows that the QB-WACE anomalies associated with the UB that often occur with the NAO(+) are strong and influenced by the North Atlantic jet (NAJ) and zonal wind strengths over Eurasia. For NAO(+)-related UB, the QB-WACE anomaly depends strongly on the location of UB, and the UB anomalies lag the NAO(+) by approximately 4-7 days.</p><p>The strength of the NAJ determines whether the combined NAO(+) and UB anomalies exhibit a negative East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR-) pattern, while the region of weak zonal winds over Eurasia and the zonal extent of the NAJ dominate the location of UB. For southward-, eastward-, and westward-displaced UBs associated with a strong NAJ, the NAO(+) favors the UB with a southward-displaced QB-WACE anomaly through wave train propagation like an EA/WR- pattern. Eastward-and southward-displaced UB anomalies induce similarly displaced cold anomalies with intrusion into southern China. However, for a northward-displaced UB, this happens without pronounced EA/WR- patterns because of a weak NAJ and is accompanied by a northward-displaced QB-WACE anomaly.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
