We model the calls as arising from a nonhomogenous Cox process with unknown intensity measure. By using the kernel convolution construction of a Gaussian process, the intensity surface is modeled using a low-dimensional representation and properly adheres to circular domain constraints. We account for the incomplete observations by marginalizing the joint intensity measure over the domain of the missing marks and also demonstrate model based imputation. We find that spatial regions of high risk for heat-related 911 calls are temporally dynamic with the highest risk occurring in urban areas during the day. We also find that elderly populations have an increased probability of calling 911 with heat-related issues than younger populations. Finally, the age of individuals and hour of the day with the highest intensity of heat-related 911 calls varies by race/ethnicity.
