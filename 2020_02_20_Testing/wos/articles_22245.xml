The simulations are validated using observations at two Arctic sites (Alert and Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory), the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) surface sites over the US, and aircraft observations over the Arctic during spring and summer 2008. Emissions from power, industrial, and biomass burning sectors are found to be the main contributors to the Arctic PM2.5 surface concentration, with contributions of similar to 30 %, similar to 25 %, and similar to 20 %, respectively. In contrast, the residential and transportation sectors are identified as the major contributors to Arctic BC, with contributions of similar to 38% and similar to 30 %. Anthropogenic emissions are the most dominant contributors (similar to 88 %) to the BC surface concentration over the Arctic annually; however, the contribution from biomass burning is significant over the summer (up to similar to 50 %). Among all geographical regions, Europe and China have the highest contributions to the BC surface concentrations, with contributions of similar to 46% and similar to 25 %, respectively. Industrial and power emissions had the highest contributions to the Arctic sulfate (SO4) surface concentration, with annual contributions of similar to 43% and similar to 41 %, respectively. Further sensitivity runs show that, among various economic sectors of all geographic regions, European and Chinese residential sectors contribute to similar to 25% and similar to 14% of the Arctic average surface BC concentration. Emissions from the Chinese industry sector and European power sector contribute similar to 12% and similar to 18% of the Arctic surface sulfate concentration. For Arctic PM2.5, the anthropogenic emissions contribute &gt; similar to 75% at the surface annually, with contributions of similar to 25% from Europe and similar to 20% from China; however, the contributions of biomass burning emissions are significant in particular during spring and summer. The contributions of each geographical region to the Arctic PM2.5 and BC vary significantly with altitude. The simulations show that the BC from China is transported to the Arctic in the midtroposphere, while BC from European emission sources are transported near the surface under 5 km, especially during winter.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
