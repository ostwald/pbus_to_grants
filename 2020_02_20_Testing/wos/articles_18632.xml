Hurricane Irene (2011) was chosen as the test case. All three options produced results comparable to observations immediately after storm passage but only options (1) and (3) captured recovery to pre-storm conditions which suggests both are feasible approaches for long-term simulations of tropical cyclones. Option (2) merits further investigation because of its greater computational efficiency and reduced complexity.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
