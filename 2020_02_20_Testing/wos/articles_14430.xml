To investigate the interaction between these processes, a large-eddy simulation (LES) model is developed with the capability to impose a broadband spectrum of time-varying finite-amplitude surface waves at its lower boundary. The LES model adopts a Boussinesq flow model and integrates the governing equations on a time-varying, surface-fitted, nonorthogonal mesh using cell-centered variables with special attention paid to the solution of the pressure Poisson equation near the wavy boundary. Weakly unstable MABLs are simulated with geostrophic winds increasing from 5 to 25 m s(-1) and wave age varying from swell-dominated to wind-wave equilibrium. The simulations illustrate cross-scale coupling as wave-impacted near-surface turbulence transitions into shear-convective rolls with increasing distance from the water. In a regime with swell, low winds, and weak heating, wave-induced vertical velocity and pressure signals are readily observed well above the standard reference height zeta(a) = 10 m. At wind-wave equilibrium, the small-scale wave-induced signals are detectable only near the water surface. Below zeta(a), a nearly-constant-flux layer is observed where the momentum flux carried by turbulence, form stress, and subgrid-scale motions shifts with varying wave age and distance above the water. The spectral content of the surface form stress is wave-age dependent, especially at low wavenumbers. The LES wind profiles deviate from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in nonequilibrium wind-wave conditions, and entrainment is greatly enhanced by shear-induced engulfment events.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
