In this study, we present five case studies of QTDW events during January and February 2005, 2006 and 2008-2010 by using the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Electrodynamics-General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM) nudged with the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System-Advanced Level Physics High Altitude (NOGAPS-ALPHA) Weather Forecast Model. With NOGAPS-ALPHA introducing more realistic lower atmospheric forcing in TIME-GCM, the QTDW events have successfully been reproduced in the TIME-GCM. The nudged TIME-GCM simulations show good agreement in zonal mean state with the NOGAPS-ALPHA 6 h reanalysis data and the horizontal wind model below the mesopause; however, it has large discrepancies in the tropics above the mesopause. The zonal mean zonal wind in the mesosphere has sharp vertical gradients in the nudged TIME-GCM. The results suggest that the parameterized gravity wave forcing may need to be retuned in the assimilative TIME-GCM.</p></abstract_text></abstract></abstracts></fullrecord_metadata></static_data><dynamic_data><cluster_related/></dynamic_data></REC></records>
