<h2>About the Table</h2>

<p>
    The table was made from the OpenSky publications since 1/1/2014 having a DOI. Each of the 4600+ rows
    in the table
    represents a publication. The "pid" link opens a new window opened to the OpenSky
    landing page for that publication. The "doi" link opens a new window opened to the resolvedl
    doi location.
</p>
<p>
    For each DOI, both WOS and Crossref web services were queried for grant information,
    namely award_ids. Note, sometimes the values for award_ids are not award_ids at all.
    If you click on an award_id, a new window is opened to a Kuali API client loaded with the
    award_id so you can see the API's response for that award_id.
</p>
<p>
    Each award_id was submitted to the UCAR Kuali API. When grant information was found in Kuali, the
    award_id was added in the kuali_verified_award_ids column.

    Future work:
    <ul id="future-work">
    <li>
        Obviously there are some character encoding issues in the responses from WOS and CrossRef. I
        am not sure if those are an artifact of the original responses or if the problems come from
        the way I have stored and printed the responses.
    </li>
        <li>
            As noted above, the data provided by the WOS and CrossRef Web Services is not reliable.
            We need to filter and parse this information so we extract any possible award_ids, and ignore
            the rest. For example, an award_id value of "award number NNX17AK19G" should be transformed to
            "NNX17AK19G" before it is submitted to the Kuali API.
        </li>
    <li>
        Eliminate false negatives. The Kuali API matches only the last (right most) 5 digits of any
        given award number so it is possible to get many results, which must be processed by the client
        to determine the best match. The current algoritm used by the client is not yet perfect, and
        returns some false negatives. For example, award_id "AGS-1641177" does not return a Kuali result,
        even though this award_id does match against several Kuali records. The current algorithm needs
        to be improved to address this case and several other known cases.
